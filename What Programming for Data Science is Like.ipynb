    "Python is a high level programming language designed to emphasize readability. There are many reasons why someone might want to use Python, though the main reasons why we have opted to use Python in this course is that it has an extensive list of data science libraries. In fact, you are likely currently using Anaconda, a set of Python tools designed specifically for our use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the very first thing that people do when learning a new programming language is learn how to print `hello world!`. In Python, this is really straight forward. Try running the following code by selecting the cell and clicking `Run` (alternatively, you can select `shift + enter`)."

    "\n",
    "Let's break down the concepts above a bit. First, you probably see the `#prints 'hello world!'` bit at the top. This is a comment. Comments are cool because they describe the code that you are executing, without themselves being executed. These are an essential part of writing good code because they tell other readers what the code does. It might seem silly at first, but once you start collaborating with other people you *will* understand the value of comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing worth discussing is the `print('hello world!')` bit. Python's `print()` function is a default function in Python which prints the string contained within the parentheses in the console. This is super handy when trying to debug code, and serves as a great starting point for our tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major difference between this exercise and past exercises is that we are using a notebook. Notebooks are increasingly popular among researchers and data scientists. In fact, I feel comfortable saying that it is _an essential tool_ for doing data science work. Without tools like Jupyter, we will create mess; replicable science needs *documentation*. Using Jupyter, we are able to effectively share code, but perhaps more importantly, to describe it. In many ways, the art of documentation is a subject in its own right, which we will touch on throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are divided into a series of cells, which each contain code that can be written and transferred however you would like. You have already created and executed a cell above, when you ran your first Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Jupyter notebooks support creating documentation using a type of code called *Markdown*. Unlike Python, which is designed to process logic, Markdown is designed to facilitate the creation of text. In other words, Markdown is not a programming language; rather it is a *markup language*. More specifically, Markdown is a derivative of the hypertext markup language (a.k.a. HTML) and builds on HTML's fundamentals. If you have ever taken an introduction to webpage design course, markdown will be very familiar to you; you can even create markdown text using HTML code!\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You can specify the type of code that each cell belongs to using the dropdown box immediately to the right of the `Run` button.\n",
    "2. You can modify Markdown cells much like Python cells."
