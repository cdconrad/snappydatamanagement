She will walk you around all of the points of interest and tell you about the local history and current happenings in town. Grand Falls is a hidden gem in New Brunswick!"

The host, Anne has some food for us and treats, what a wonderful surprise that was. She is very quick to reply back and very helpful in every way. We met her and what a warm sweet lady she is. The home is at the end of the street which makes for privacy and being peaceful and quiet. We highly recommend this beautiful spot and it’s gracious host."
10282546,658518835,Grand Falls Town,44073,81971867,Sheila,"Anne’s place is like a home away from home. It has everything you need to be comfortable. Great views, lots of light, functional and little touches like books to read, Netflix available, good wifi, a patio to sit on, a nice bench to overlook the view of the river, comfortable beds and more. I spent two weeks there self isolating and she checked in on me to see if I needed anything which I really appreciated. Highly recommend."
10282546,717313973,Grand Falls Town,44187,169779669,Chantal,"She cancelled the morning of our departure, even though we chatted and confirmed the day before. Enough said."

10282546,4.31753E+17,Grand Falls Town,44426,165884633,Samsuddin,"This one night it rained hard, and rainwater seeped through the main front entrance door. There is no internet reception in up stair floors, because the modem is located in the basement. It was very hot summer days during my stay, one interesting trick to keep the house cooler I would like to share: there is an air cooler in the basement. I have put it in cool mode with air swing upward and temperature set to the lowest, that's it - you will have nice and pleasant temperature throughout the house during the day and night as well with windows closed."

21427308,477608161,Grand Falls,43644,139293171,Stacey,Barry’s place was such a great find for us. We needed to be close to Limestone and in the past have always had to stay in Canada; this stay was such a huge and welcomed change for us. The house is great and included everything we needed and more. The location was awesome as we really wanted to enjoy the beauty of our surroundings. Next time we will build in extra time for golf. Barry was super friendly and made check-in and out a breeze. We were very pleased and will stay there again.

21427308,534257180,Grand Falls,43730,181384300,Edward,My second time at the Eagle’s Nest. Even better than my first stay. Perfect weather. House is in a great location to enjoy the scenery. Everything was sparkling clean and had everything I needed and more. Feels like home away from home now.

21427308,615815378,Grand Falls,43898,335202304,Joel,"The Eagles Nest is a great little place nestled just off the road between the country club (across the street) and a neighbor (to the right separated by a tree row). Looking out the windows you get a sense of space and privacy without being completely alone. The property is clean, well maintained and is very comfortable! New appliances, ample furniture and proximity to amenities make this cabin really relaxing. Check out the Boondocks Grille! We were blown away by the food! We enjoyed our stay here and will surely recommend it if your in the area! Side note, if seeking more of a secluded stay, the Eagles Nest may not be for you."
21427308,618592629,Grand Falls,43905,266126416,Shelby,We had a great weekend at the Eagle's Nest in Fort Fairfield.  The cabin was extremely comfortable and easy to find.  It had everything we needed and more.  We stayed in Fort Fairfield for a day of snowmobiling and to dine at Canterbury Royale.  Barry was an amazing host and very quick to respond to our questions.  He was kind enough to meet up with us on a whim to guide us over to the ITS trail directly from the Eagle's Nest.  We dined at Boondocks one evening and Canterbury Royale the next.  Both restaurants were great and we particularly enjoyed the 5-star experience of CR.  Fort Fairfield and the surrounding communities had plenty of snow and friendly faces!!  We enjoyed riding the rail beds for the first time.  It was a fantastic weekend!

Barry was a great host helped us with anything we needed and also gave us our privacy. Definitely recommend the bears den for a summer's stay and the eagles nest for winter stay, my fiance and I had a great time at the cabin and appreciate the hospitality."
21427308,625076886,Grand Falls,43968,319250841,Karyn,Such a beautiful and clean place! Many thoughtful touches. We did not want for a thing.  Would highly recommend.

21427308,632282672,Grand Falls,44008,3086305,Johnathan,"Barry and Cindy are what all airbnb hosts should aspire to be.<br/><br/>My sister and I rented one of their cabins.  It was wonderfully quaint, tucked away behind their home.<br/><br/>We arrived around midnight. Barry stayed up to take us to the cabin.  Immediately you could tell he was a great dude who enjoyed people.   He and his wife Cindy came down a few days later to shoot the breeze over a bonfire and we hit it off. <br/><br/>They invited us into their home, cooked for us, invited us to join them for dinner at a restaurant downtown.  They took us on a tour of the area to spot animals. We saw a moose, bear, deer, ... all in a single trip!  He invited us to go golfing but we couldn't make it.  It felt like almost every day they were checking in on us or inviting us to do something.  <br/><br/>This experience sets the bar for what it means to be a host.  I don't know when, but we'll be back."
21427308,635077429,Grand Falls,44017,350320784,Shanna,"Amazing & wonderful accommodations. Everything was perfect. It was our 1st Airbnb experience & it was more than we expected from the cleanliness, a super cute cabin, plus all the extras! It was great! Thank you & we definitely will book again in the future!"

21427308,643644050,Grand Falls,44040,187735584,Bryony,This hidden gem was an amazing find! His description did not do it justice. It is a gorgeous spot and perhaps the best family vacation we have had in a very long time! Thank you Barry! <br/>There is no need to bring anything more than your favorite book to read and a camera for the memories!
21427308,647753655,Grand Falls,44050,166375228,Jacqueline,This place is a cute little fairy tale cabin . It’s great for a family . Rest relax and reset is the goal this is your place .
21427308,649521260,Grand Falls,44053,349821163,Levi,The most relaxing and beautiful place to go on vacation! Couldn’t have been anywhere better!
21427308,653486314,Grand Falls,44062,286529934,Deepam,"This hidden gem was an amazing find. Barry is an amazing host and his cabin is at the perfect location for some isolation and peace. Definitely recommend going to bears den in summer, its vibrant and you can access the pond too.<br/>Barry also called us after we had vacated to inform us about the bag we had forgotten at his cabin and mailed it to us immediately. <br/>Best host, I would definitely recommend you to stay at his places."
21427308,654826596,Grand Falls,44065,339250713,Aubrey,"I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for a getaway! The house is adorable and has everything you'll need, and the view of the sunset is absolutely stunning. The area is quiet but has some fun things to do, especially if you like the outdoors! Barry was incredibly kind and hospitable and we hope to come back again!"
21427308,658559691,Grand Falls,44073,175943767,Tiffany,"A+! Absolutely wonderful! <br/>My husband and I stayed from a Thursday to a Sunday and we loved everything about Barry’s place. The Eagles Nest is clean, cozy, stocked with all sorts of amenities and in a beautiful location. Pots, pans, towels, shower soap, AC, heat, Roku, lots of chairs, fireplace - I could keep going. The cabin is wonderfully decorated with a Maine feel and is very welcoming. We had one beautiful day and it was so nice to sit on the porch and read. We also had one really rainy day and we stayed cozy inside with tea and coffee (which were available in the pantry!) <br/>I highly recommend Barry’s Eagles Nest for your next Eastern Aroostook county stay. 1/2 hour to Presque Isle, 1/2 hour to Caribou, a bit over an hour to Madawaska. This part of Maine doesn’t have a huge selection of attractions in the summer, but if you’re ready to hangout, go hiking and view some potato farms- you’ll have a great stay!"
21427308,662626613,Grand Falls,44084,16438104,Dara,We stayed in the Bear's Den cabin and it was so wonderful!! Not another structure in sight-just nature! Barry replied to every message nearly instantly and was on hand to show us how to get to the cabin. We heard coyotes as we sat outside the cabin enjoying a fire. Barry gave us a quick call the next day to see how we were doing and to ask if we needed anything. Fantastic experience! We hope to visit again soon!!
21427308,663822453,Grand Falls,44087,340177928,Alisha,Beautiful cabin! We had a wonderful stay!

Not a ton of stuff going on or to do in the late fall, but driving around the area was a lot of fun and Barry was very helpful and a great host in all aspects. Would recommend, especially when/if all these COVID restrictions lift for Canada."

21427308,717899891,Grand Falls,44189,141659289,Sudeep,One of the best cabins I’ve ever stayed at. Has such a great view and is a clean place to stay at. Would recommend this place to anyone who likes staying in a quite/remote place
21427308,721910927,Grand Falls,44200,260195001,Billy,"We had an awesome time at The Eagle’s Nest. It’s a fantastic space for smaller or larger groups. Barry is a great host and has his guests’ best interests in mind.<br/><br/>Btw, make sure to check out Boondock’s Grille in town for some awesome poutine!"
21427308,723650651,Grand Falls,44207,12724753,David,Great cabin and perfect location for us. Wonderfully clean and well appointed. Barry was very quick to respond to messages and a great host.

21427308,734805495,Grand Falls,44254,375529297,Matthew,"Of your looking for a place to stay that is away from the busy main roads and the slamming of hotel room doors the Eagles Nest is perfect.  Not far from recreational trails, beautiful setting, extremely comfortable and outstanding hospitality from our host Barry.  I would and have recommended this cabin to anyone that is looking for a place to stay in northern Maine"
21427308,736078709,Grand Falls,44258,224712868,Nichole,"What a great cabin! Beautiful location and super clean. Barry was great, answered all our question."
21427308,739408212,Grand Falls,44270,389470339,Linwood,Small cabin but just big enough for the 5 of us.Very clean and the bathroom and kitchen had extra amenities which was nice.The pull out couch/bed could have been more comfortable but had a piece of foam for a little more padding.The private snowmobile trail out to the main trail was a little longer than expected at 5 miles and was quite rough.It would benefit from a small drag being pulled over this and a few more markers as it was hard to find the trail coming back after dark.Still-a great place to stay and would definitely come back again.
21427308,743076158,Grand Falls,44283,237394222,Kara,The Eagles Nest was a great spot for a weekend getaway!! <br/>It was super clean and tidy. Had everything you’d need minus your groceries. <br/>Barry was quick to respond prior to check in when I had questions as well as after.
21427308,757077665,Grand Falls,44326,387557030,Joseph,The Eagles Nest was beautiful. We were super late for check in due to driving up but Barry made sure everything was ready for us when we got there. The place was clean and well kept. 10/10 would stay again
21427308,759009271,Grand Falls,44332,396237887,Erika,The small two bed room cabin is in a quiet location just on the outskirts of Fort Fairfield Maine. Beautiful location and lots to see. I highly recommend this cabin for a get away.
21427308,760683713,Grand Falls,44337,236088028,Colleen,Super cute place! Very clean! No complaint!
21427308,764264017,Grand Falls,44346,304133974,Brian,Great place right on the canadian border. You can see canandians  golfing across the street. Nice views and super clean. Barry is a great host.
21427308,766581355,Grand Falls,44352,135537534,Eric,5 stars across the board!! immaculately clean cabin. Everything was just fantastic - a really great get away.
21427308,3.94838E+17,Grand Falls,44375,352682576,Paul,What a great place to stay. Perfect for golf in the summer or winter fun on the trails. The cabin has great views and is so peaceful. The kitchen was well equipped and the laundry was easy to access. The cabin is as nice as it is photogenic and would be very welcoming after a cold day out in the snow.  Barry was the perfect host. This is small town Maine. We jokingly mentioned to the waitress at The Boondocks restaurant in Fort Fairfield that we were eating out because the can opener was broken. Next morning Barry turned up with a new can opener! I highly recommend this or any of the other properties Barry has just up the street.  Thank you Barry for making our stay so pleasant.
21427308,4.04946E+17,Grand Falls,44389,178698048,Amanda,"Clean, cute, and stocked with all the basics! Very peaceful area. Would definitely visit again."

Very clean, easy check in and out and everything we needed once we picked up a few groceries. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quiet getaway with all the comforts of home."
21427308,4.1077E+17,Grand Falls,44397,406993392,Erin,This cabin was such an awesome getaway! Such a cute and cozy spot to relax and enjoy the views of fields and rolling hills. We were right on the border of Canada which was amazing as well. I loved fort Fairfield and this cabin was way above expectations. I also loved the fire pit!!
21427308,4.13679E+17,Grand Falls,44401,335706769,Alterino,"Awesome hospitality, the cabin was absolutely gorgeous, the view was amazing every day, quiet relaxing spot."

21427308,4.3536E+17,Grand Falls,44431,399880979,Autumn,The Eagle's Nest was a mountain lover's oasis.  I could not have asked for a better home to escape and relax.  Barry went above and beyond providing all the extra little things that made it perfect.
21427308,4.37597E+17,Grand Falls,44434,73327490,Kati,"We absolutely loved staying in this cabin. It was very cozy, super clean, and had everything we needed. Barry was an excellent host and we’ll definitely be back!"

21427308,4.44781E+17,Grand Falls,44444,221715478,Brittney,"Great cabin - Nice lot with decent views, and while the pandemic prevented us from using it, the proximity to the golf course is unbeatable."
21427308,4.58646E+17,Grand Falls,44463,394587387,Talitha,"It was a cute little cabin. When speaking with the owner before booking he made it sound like it was more like his other Cabin (bears den) but it doesn’t have a loft, wood stove, or as much privacy as the Bear’s den pictures portray so that was disappointing. Otherwise it’s a cute little cabin to get away for peace and quiet."
21427308,4.63617E+17,Grand Falls,44470,404491798,Krys,We liked the cabin very much! It had everything we needed. We liked that it had a washer & dryer. Location was great for us. Great ease with checking in! We also stayed at the Bear's Den another one of Barry's cabins in July and we loved that too!
21427308,4.65173E+17,Grand Falls,44472,16340875,Kyle,"Highly recommend staying here. The cabin is clean, comfortable and has everything you need.

21427308,4.81018E+17,Grand Falls,44494,17791443,Wendi,"The Eagle’s Nest was great. Super clean, very well appointed. Beds were comfy. The porch and fire pit with chairs was a great way to spend the evening. The kitchen had everything we needed. It was quiet and the scenery was really pretty. We’ll visit again for sure! I had a couple simple questions and Barry got right back to me."
21427308,4.88983E+17,Grand Falls,44505,422590048,Justin,"When we arrived everything was clean and in good order. Barry and his wife Cindy were very polite and inviting. He was knowledgeable and willing to share his knowledge on the area we are thinking to move too. He allowed my family and I to look at the other camps he has available, showed us his taxidermy work and even allowed me to come into his shop and learn. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in the area. Thanks Barry and Cindy!!!"
21427308,4.90563E+17,Grand Falls,44507,57508170,Michael,Awesome place! Don't hesitate to book.

Barry was gracious enough to provide us with a flexible check-in, even stopping by to make sure we had everything we needed.  He provided great recommendations for food and told us to contact him anytime if we needed anything.  The cabin is gorgeous and built by the owners...it's just the right amount of cozy to relax and provides amazing views of the night sky!  My husband and I can't say enough good things about this place and the hosts...if you're going anywhere near Fort Fairfield, this is the place to stay!"
21427308,5.31053E+17,Grand Falls,44563,425635954,Matthew,"Great location, very clean, all accommodations were met. Overall great, however had issues with internet connectivity throughout our stay. Great if you’re looking for a rustic vibe but could use a technological update."
21427308,5.36931E+17,Grand Falls,44571,58602228,Ben,A really awesome place to stay! The seclusion was awesome. We spotted a family of deer right off the back deck. Great amenities and a cozy environment. I definitely recommend!
21427308,5.44116E+17,Grand Falls,44581,328286503,Brandon,Barry was very accommodating and very available for any questions. Cabin exceeded expectations overall. Easy to find location. 10/10 recommend any of his cabins available for rent!
21427308,5.51347E+17,Grand Falls,44591,309070293,James,Great get away and Barry went above and beyond to make sure we could snowmobile directly from camp.  Camp was warm and cozy even at -36 degrees. Just an absolute gem of a log cabin.
21427308,5.66668E+17,Grand Falls,44612,325649396,Tammy,"Everything was perfection! We were there to ride our sleds.  We had a day of rain, but the cabin was cozy and had everything we needed.  We had a wonderful time!"

21427308,6.32544E+17,Grand Falls,44703,250725989,Jessica,"Our stay at the Eagles Nest was great. Beautiful view. The cabin was cozy, clean, and conveniently located for us. We didn’t get to use the porch or fire pit outside due to rain, but they were nice additions. Would stay here again!"
21427308,6.49277E+17,Grand Falls,44726,351754284,Ian,"Beautiful location and scenery, in a well-appointed quiet and comfortable cabin!  We loved it and would love to go back sometime if we ever make it out there."
21427308,6.5724E+17,Grand Falls,44737,454920681,Angela,"Barry is a very attentive host and it shows in his rental. The interior and exterior of the cabin are very well maintained and ready to be enjoyed. Conveniences such as coffee, laundry detergent, dry food staples were provided as well as ample outdoor seating and firewood for the outdoor fire pit. When we reached out to Barry to ask about getting more firewood, he quickly delivered a load and stacked it near the fire pit. We suspect if we had other requests, Barry would have been equally quick in his response. Hosts like Barry make travel enjoyable and we are happy to recommend this and any other of Barry's rental properties. Thanks for everything Barry, & I enjoyed getting to meet you and chat with you a little bit too!"
21427308,6.62207E+17,Grand Falls,44744,208273296,Colleen,"Great communication with the host. Barry and his wife have beautiful cabins. They are spotless and reasonably priced. Make sure you read their descriptions so you don’t pack your house to come here. Did that the first year (first Airbnb experience) brought everything and didn’t need half! Second time here, won’t be my last! Keep up the great hospitality Barry and Cindy, you are the best!!"
21427308,6.73821E+17,Grand Falls,44760,276061930,Gerry,We enjoyed our time at the Bear’s Den cabin immensely. Everything was spotlessly clean with all the amenities listed on Airbnb. <br/>Barry was a perfect host and we will definitely return next year.
21427308,6.89828E+17,Grand Falls,44782,450943361,Pete,"This was our first Airbnb rental and it went way beyond expectation.  The Eagle's Nest location was awesome, views were spectacular,  with quick access to Fort Fairfield, Presque Isle and Caribou, it was easy to get around the County!  Only complaint was being required to drive 22 miles and 40 minutes to the awesome Aroostook Valley Country Club that was across the road and about 100 meters from the Eagles Nest!  Well, we have to admit that the Eagle's Nest is on the American side of the US/Canada border and the AVCC is in New Brunswick! And, as we all know, since 9/11 the borders have been a lot more tricky to cross!  Thanks Barry, and when I come back again I will try one of the other two (Bear's Den or Moose Lodge) of your properties."
21427308,6.91206E+17,Grand Falls,44784,189787477,Zach,"This cabin is the perfect place to relax, with beautiful views of northern Maine in every direction.    Can’t recommend this charming spot enough!"

21427308,6.95547E+17,Grand Falls,44790,46114566,Danielle,Barry and Cindy are amazing hosts! The cabin was very neat and clean and supplied amazingly! Haystack mountain is close and a beautiful site to see as suggested by Barry. Great comfortable cabin to enjoy with family. The area is rural but the cabin is on a main road so comfortable for everyone.

21427308,7.34721E+17,Grand Falls,44844,95469290,Pritha,Very nice and cozy place right near Canada if you're looking to do some activities there as well. We loved the fireplace out in front. Barry was available through call and accommodating 🙂

21427308,7.79762E+17,Grand Falls,44906,202371852,Teresa,"Barry was a great host! Warmed up the cabin for us right before we got there and came to personally greet us. The cabin was great for the price! We stayed there during a cold and rainy day & were able to stay warm all night! Pretty secluded, but also only 10 min from the local gas station, convince store, & a beautiful antique store. We had a lovely time, defiantly planning to come back again when it’s a bit warmer."
21427308,8.10205E+17,Grand Falls,44948,248637202,Lauren,Was my first time up In northern maine! It was a very beautiful log cabin and it was very peaceful and relaxing. Very quiet area for a calm weekend. Has some really good resturants just a few miles away. House was really clean and everything he has in the kitchen came in handy. Would definitely come back again!!
21427308,8.29739E+17,Grand Falls,44975,423659427,Kimberly,The cabin is beautiful just like the pictures.  The floors were cold but we had slippers so not a problem. The trail to the main trail was pretty well marked. Might suggest marking the stakes on the main trail to help with finding our way back (maybe paint them orange or another bright color especially for night time). The neighbors and ourselves added markings to help. Barry was great and any question we had he was in touch with the answer immediately.  We would definitely look at staying again if we go to that area.
21427308,8.34817E+17,Grand Falls,44982,372839286,Jennifer,"Good value, nice location, would be nice to have a map of the trail to get to the ITS. But was marked. Overall everything was very nice."
21427308,8.40587E+17,Grand Falls,44990,486941043,Laurianne,"The Eagles Nest exceeded our expectations. The cabin was very nice. Exceptionally clean and easy to find. We wanted to snowmobile and we were able to leave right from the front door. After a four mile ride we were on ITS 81. Fort Fairfield has everything you might need. Groceries, gas and a great Taxidermist for those that enjoy hunting. While at the cabin the kitchen was fully stocked. Overall the cabin was perfect for our stay. The owner stopped in. Just a super nice guy. We hope to visit again. Be sure to see the sunset. Beautiful."
21427308,8.4209E+17,Grand Falls,44992,208341540,Renee,"Very cute cabin, clean. Beds are quite stiff, I would suggest bringing a mattress pad if you prefer a softer mattress."

The bedding was warm and ample for cold, winter nights.  <br/>Anne, the hostess, was very pleasant and easy to deal with."
24309686,6.15868E+17,Grand Falls,44680,19260939,Julie,"Anne a été une hôtesse merveilleuse. La maison est propre et confortable. Les communications ont été faciles, rapides et claires. Je suis allée dormir chez elle, car mon équipe et moi allions travailler à l’installation des 4 tyroliennes zig zag haut-dessus des chutes à 10minutes de sa maison. Nous nous sommes sentis comme à la maison et ce fut apprécié d’avoir une laveuse et sécheuse, car il a plus toute la semaine. Merci beaucoup Anne."

24309686,6.87647E+17,Grand Falls,44779,447127147,Lynn,Loved this quaint farmhouse. Tons of room to roam and our family all had their own private spot to hang out and relax when some downtime was needed.  We hosted our east coast family a few times and loved the space that the kitchen/ dining room and front porch offered.   Would recommend this place 100%.  Anne is a great host.  Ans quick to respond with a couple of questions we had.
24309686,6.8839E+17,Grand Falls,44780,20656061,Caryn,What a gem of a house! We really enjoyed our stay. The house was perfect for our large group. The location is very private and land is beautiful. Anne was very easy to communicate with. Would stay here again if we travel to Grand Falls again.

Stunning view from front porch, private location, very comfortable interior….rustic, spacious, very quaint and it had all the conveniences we were looking for. We were in town for a wedding and were able to host lunch and dinner for other family members who were staying at local hotel.  They loved the place and the space it offered us to just hang around and enjoy each other’s company.  Refreshing swim in lake after a good hike.  Would totally recommend this place and would stay again in a heartbeat if ever again our family finds itself in Grand Falls!"

The space is spotless & so comfortable ... got a great nice sleep on the cozy bed and loved the special touches in the bathroom like Epsom salts and bath bombs were so welcome after a long car day. They were also wonderful hosts who took the time to come over when I needed something - and brought snacks! Highly recommend staying with them instead of a hotel - you won’t regret it!

The apartment is very spacious for 4 people (for us Europeans what we understand by typical American) and equipped with everything we needed and beyond.

29761278,6.9852E+17,Grand Falls Town,44794,64736351,Tammy,"The space is huge…. Having the washer and dryer was great after days of travelling.  The furnishings were comfortable but the rooms a bit warm and in need of a fan.<br/>When we arrived, and it lasted all of our stay, there was a chemical cleaning smell that gave us headaches.  Stephanie was speedy to apologize. Parking was easy and plentiful making a short walk to the falls easy after a day of driving."
29761278,6.99249E+17,Grand Falls Town,44795,40641686,Victoria,"My boyfriend and I loved this Airbnb! It was HUGE and extremely clean and felt like the perfect last night away after an amazing east coast trip before heading home to Ottawa. So many details left us incredibly appreciative to stay in this Airbnb, including the adorable welcome note and back story of the owners, the Brita water filter, pre made ice cubes, a big comfy couch and a huge tv with all the platforms you could want (Netflix, Disney +, etc). We also really appreciated the private washer and dryer to wash all of our clothes before driving home. This meant we didn’t have to do laundry after arriving home from vacation, which was a huge bonus for us. Thank you so much for having us!"

29761278,7.02875E+17,Grand Falls Town,44800,149290464,Betty-Ann,"Thanks for another great stay.  We had a hotel booked for our return trip from the maritimes back to Ontario, but the apartment was far better than a hotel, so we cancelled the hotel and booked this one again.  Hope to see you next year in another trip out east!"
29761278,7.0352E+17,Grand Falls Town,44801,273398555,Osman,"Stephane's place was perfect for us to rest and enjoy Grand Falls.

29761278,7.15917E+17,Grand Falls Town,44818,57486183,Robert,"Tha apartment is very modern, stylish and comfortable, situated in the main street so perfectly located for shops and restaurants. The main living area is large but lacks natural light other than a single 'light tube', so electric lighting is essential. Excellent appliances and furnishings throughout, but a little lacking in the crockery and glassware department, which is easily fixed."

29761278,7.37684E+17,Grand Falls Town,44848,36168187,Alex,Best AirBNB I've ever stayed in.  Would love to visit again in the spring when the falls are roaring but even in the off season the Falls are impressive with the rock formations. Stephane's apartment was so comfortable and modern and clean. I highly recommend.
29761278,7.49919E+17,Grand Falls Town,44865,483882300,Marc,Apartment is on second floor with very steep steps. If you have mobility issues and luggage not ideal for sure. <br/>Place itself is nice and well furnished. <br/>We had to leave a day early as our flights got changed and needed to avoid a 26 hour layover sent Stephane a message Saturday and 4 days later no reply. <br/>I guess he did not want to refund a day. And I did not even ask for refund just a heads up.  <br/>I go to grand falls often and always stay in hotels but thought I’d try something different but I’ll stick to hotels in the future. <br/>I’m not recommending you stay or don’t stay there that’s your choice. But I won’t again. <br/>Also located in low income area.

31568852,425959192,Grand Falls Town,43543,157449207,Erin,"My fiancé and I stayed here for 2 nights for our anniversary and the apartment surpassed our expectations! It’s such a beautiful residence and much bigger than we expected from the provided pictures. The only inconvenience we encountered were hearing loud footsteps above us, however it isn’t constant and it’s easy to ignore. We loved staying here and would love to come back in the summer!"

Stephane responded to our last-minute booking request at 11:50pm within minutes which really helped us out. The whole booking and checking in process went very quickly and smoothly. The time from first messaging Stephane to stepping into the home was under 20 minutes. The check-in went smoothly and the place was very big, comfortable and clean. We highly recommend staying here!"

31568852,515209647,Grand Falls Town,43699,129461435,Shirley,"Stopped for the night at Stephane's on my road trip back from Halifax. The apartment is big, clean and beautiful. Enjoyed my walk through the cute town and got to see the falls. When back at the apartment it was nice to do a load of laundry while relaxing and watching some TV. You may hear some footsteps above at times. The only windows are in the bedroom so not much natural light coming in, but the apartment is gorgeous and has great lighting. Highly recommend!"
31568852,516567596,Grand Falls Town,43701,9926216,Carolyn,Our stay was quick but so comfortable! We stayed the night at Stephane’s place on our way home to Ontario from Nova Scotia. The place is so much bigger than pictured. It was in a fantastic location and the restaurant that was recommended was just a block away (and delicious)! We would definitely stay again.

It is brand new, stylish, modern and well equipped. The location is perfect within walking distance to the beautiful Falls and restaurants. <br/>Stephane was prompt in his responses and allowed us to change our reservation last minute when Hurricane Dorian caused us to leave Cape Breton a day earlier than planned.<br/>We will definitely stay here again next time we are in the area and highly recommend this apartment to future guests. You will not be disappointed!"

The place is beautiful, incredibly clean, great detail given to supply everything you would need and my interactions with Stephane were top notch. It’s situated in a quaint little area and while I didn’t stay long, I enjoyed walking around before settling in for a great sleep in a comfortable bed. I would definitely book again."
31568852,4.57109E+17,Grand Falls Town,44461,63767892,Olivia,Was very spacious with a lovely kitchen but sadly wasn’t expecting it to be a basement apartment. Also there’s no ventilation or a/c (the only 2 windows were ground windows in the bedroom looking into car grills). Also there’s a lot of construction on every side so be prepared to walk through dirt to get to the apartment since there’s no more sidewalk. Bed is very stiff and pillows were uncomfortable.
31568852,4.57879E+17,Grand Falls Town,44462,148605407,Sharon,"Very clean, modern, and a large space to relax and rest. Everything we need was provided. Great location to the Falls and main street for restaurants.  I would maybe add an extra shelf in the bathroom to hold your toiletry bag but other than that it was amazing! Will stay again."

Apartment is beautifully decorated and very modern. There is only a small window, and that's in the bedroom, so hard to look outside, but great interior lights make up for the deficit.

34684111,491645662,Grand Falls Town,43666,77794208,Elvan,"Hard to pick what I like best! The unit was sparkling clean, well decorated and super comfy.  We arrived at 3:30 in the morning after a nine hour drive.  It was easy to find and easy to get into.  The beds were comfy and the linens were nice.  There was ample room for the family. Stephane was super prompt with answering all my questions (including finding out there is a keurig coffee maker).  There is a drug store right across the street where we picked up milk and coffee cream -  very convenient.  We were driving to PEI and wanted a scheduled stop along the way and Grand Falls was perfect - not far off the highway and the falls made a nice morning activIty.<br/>Highly recommend this rental!

34684111,4.11463E+17,Grand Falls Town,44398,193276549,Serge,"The place is very nice and modern. The only issue was with communication. We had sent Stephane a message at noon, and he never responded to us though he had taken our money. I had to call him to find out any information regarding which unit we were staying in, etc., and when he responded he sounded like he had no idea that we were going to be staying with him though the transaction went through. The lavishness of the place is marred by unprofessionalism."

34684111,4.18024E+17,Grand Falls Town,44407,9996052,Lucie,"Super-easy contactless check-in with drive-up-to-door parking spot were really appreciated. Motorized easy-chair and gel-topped mattress made me realise what I was missing :) I also appreciated being able to do my laundry en route to Halifax (laundry soap provided). Not a room with a view if that's what you're after, but a comfortable stay. My kids were excited about the three TVs--one in each bedroom and one in the living room. We brought our own shampoo/conditioner, so didn't notice if that was provided. Oh, and for a fancy meal, check out the White Moose not too far up the road. Mmmmm...."

The place was perfect!<br/>Comfy beds, a TV in both bedrooms and the living room, all the cutlery and dishes we needed, full laundry and lots of space for everyone. <br/>The best surprise was going for an evening walk and discovering the town itself, the beautiful bronze of hometown Ron Turcotte, the legendary jockey best known as the thoroughbred race horse rider of Secretariat, winner of the U.S. Triple Crown: simply stunning.<br/><br/>Lovely little shops, a fine Italian restaurant are nearby. There is some construction happening on the Boulevard but it’s almost finished, nice wide sidewalks  and of course a short stroll to the breathtaking falls!<br/>Thank you! We will return but this time will stay for a few days."

34684111,4.34011E+17,Grand Falls Town,44429,476120,Ritu,The unit was in a great location for one night on our way from PEI to Old Quebec. It was clean and very well kept!!!
34684111,4.34721E+17,Grand Falls Town,44430,168983694,Stephanie,Travelled to PEI from Norfolk Ontario. This was about a 12 hours drive for us with a few stops in between. It was the perfect place to stop and rest for the night. Clean apartment and easy to find. It is at the back of the building on the ground level and you access it directly which was nice since we arrived a little late with the time change. This place had everything we needed for a good nights rest. Ac and lights were on when we got there which was very nice.
34684111,4.426E+17,Grand Falls Town,44441,116985121,Mike,Nice two bedroom apartment in a quiet location of the high street. Everything you need for a comfortable stay. Ample parking outside the door. Stephane communicate well with us before during and after our stay.

34684111,4.49191E+17,Grand Falls Town,44450,20163675,Neil & Joan,"This place is fantastic. Very spacious and comfortable. Parking was right outside the door, which for me was a real bonus as we tend to not travel lightly. Other than coffee, no other food items were supplied. But lots of places near by for whatever you may want."
34684111,4.52828E+17,Grand Falls Town,44455,20163675,Neil & Joan,We were travelling from Windsor to Halifax. We stayed here on the way there and liked it so much we booked for the way home as well. I highly recommend this place.
34684111,4.54262E+17,Grand Falls Town,44457,187738506,E Ann,"This is absolutely the best AB&B that we have stayed in during our 3 week trip of the Atlantic provinces.  Stephanie helped guide us in due to construction in the neighbourhood.  We could walk to restaurants and the falls and gorge.  The apartment was safe, clean quiet and well equipped.  All in all the perfect end to our trip!"
34684111,4.54966E+17,Grand Falls Town,44458,147380337,Monique,"Very clean, well located, quiet and comfortable place. I have booked again for next month which says it all."

34684111,5.81808E+17,Grand Falls Town,44633,448530014,Genia,"Originally booked another accomodation with this host, but the booked unit was double booked so host was kind enough to offer a better unit for the same price!<br/>Very nice, clean apartment. All ameneties are good quality and well maintained! Extremely happy with the stay as the place was great, neigbours are extremely friendly and the host highly responsive.

Check in was a breeze. <br/><br/>We are used to staying at 5 star+ hotels, and this location was better then most hotels we’ve stayed at. <br/><br/>Appliances were fantastic and new. I was able to do our kids laundry quickly so everything was clean for our trip home. Couches have power recline and are super comfortable. <br/><br/>Kitchen is well stocked with everything you’d need. <br/><br/>Beautiful decorated, we will definitely come back!!"
34684111,5.91908E+17,Grand Falls Town,44647,111346971,Caroline,"The place itself was beautiful and spacious. They did a great job in renovating and adding nice appliances. It was just a little hard to get there since the entrance is on another street. Stephane sent us an image to help us getting there, however the streets around don't have the names very visible. Try to have the back entrance on your gps or phone instead of the actual address. Coffee machine is Keurig, works with K-cups, don't bring your grounded coffee. You might need to bring cooking oil if you plan on cooking."
34684111,5.94833E+17,Grand Falls Town,44651,33425932,Mark,We have stayed with Stephane twice and thoroughly enjoyed our stays. His places are beautiful and Stephane makes check-in and out very easy and was very accommodating. Apartment was very clean and had everything our family of four needed for our trips.

34684111,6.51377E+17,Grand Falls Town,44729,74885826,Fred,"This is a very comfortable, immaculate, thoroughly updated apartment in a very convenient, safe location. We had not been to Grand Falls before and really enjoyed having the apartment within walking distance to a fine local restaurant and to the spectacular falls, over which pass almost as much water as over Niagara. Communication with Stephane was easy and helpful, and there was a very useful welcome packet with house and local information. For us, the stay was brief in transit from one place to another, but with the lovely apartment and attractive community, we might well make it a destination in the future."
34684111,6.55718E+17,Grand Falls Town,44735,42935153,Wayne,"Great spot, would stay again for sure!"
34684111,6.57147E+17,Grand Falls Town,44737,110505644,Julie,"Stephane’s place was amazing! We stopped there for one night to break up a very long trip and it was just great! Ground floor load-in, clean space, comfy beds, etc. we walked down to the falls which are very close by and went to dinner a block or two away at Le Grand Sault  which has the most fantastic pizza, poutine and seafood lasagna - a real treat! I highly recommend this place and will be booking again."

34684111,6.78159E+17,Grand Falls Town,44766,99406072,Samuel,Stephane's Urban Escape was perfect for our stopover on our way to PEI. Clean and comfortable for a good night's rest. Grocery store was very close by and we were able to cook in the apartment. There was also a washer and dryer though we didn't need to use it.

34684111,6.93433E+17,Grand Falls Town,44787,229996249,Alana,"We stayed at the Urban Escape location on our way from ON to NS and then again on the way back a week later. The location was great and perfect walking distance to the Falls. Quaint town and amenities were close by.<br/>It stated that the door code is always changed between visits, but there were other guests between our stays and the code was the same as the first stay. Cleanliness was decent (mostly surface cleaning). <br/>It would have been very helpful to have known how to get to the parking in back. It's on a boulevard and you have to go down a side street to get around to the back."
