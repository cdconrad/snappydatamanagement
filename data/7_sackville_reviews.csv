15764884,115047756,Sackville,42695,103885636,Athanasia,I felt very welcome at Old Sackville.  The location is perfect for Mount Allison student parents.  Will return next football season for sure.

15764884,145511737,Sackville,42843,45597633,Lisa,This was a lovely place to stay while in Sackville to pack up my daughter's dorm room. Jacques' century old farmhouse was lovely and so peaceful. The bed in the room was very comfortable and there was a nice view out the front window. Jacques was very kind and helpful - he even helped me take apart my daughter's bike to fit in the car! I would highly recommend Jacques' place to other parents or anyone looking for a restful night in charming Sackville.
15764884,146355532,Sackville,42847,23875947,Layla,"This is a beautiful house located in a quiet neighbourhood right next to the Mount Allison campus, which is ideal for family visits to MtA students.

15764884,188795390,Sackville,42977,145257542,Dana,"Jacques place was close to downtown Sackville and not too far from Moncton.<br/>We thought it would be closer to Hopewell Rocks, but it was an hour away.<br/>Everything was good, just a little noisy at night with traffic.  We had toast and coffee at breakfast and good conversation with Jacques in the evening."
15764884,190557069,Sackville,42982,124844174,Lori,Jacques is a great host.  Very friendly and easy going. Jacques knows the area well and this is very helpful when you don't know what to do or where to go. Felt at home.
15764884,194030458,Sackville,42993,145492913,Tabitha,"5* all round! Very welcoming and friendly host. I had everything I needed (comfy bed, clean room, private bathroom and essentials).

Jacques home is very clean and comfortable and full of character and I really enjoyed chatting with Jacques in the evening over dinner or a glass of wine.

15764884,336553532,Sackville,43387,212290934,Sarah,"I stayed at Jacque's Airbnb while I was attending a conference at Mount Allison University. He was very flexible and accommodating for check in, and the location was only three minutes from the university campus, which was ideal for me. The space was clean, private and quaint. It's a beautiful old house, and while I spent most of my time at the conference, I had a very enjoyable stay."

Er kennt die Umgebung sehr gut, gibt gerne Anregungen für Unternehmungen und ist generell sehr großzügig und hilfsbereit.

17040434,154652929,Sackville,42880,5272514,Sharon,"My husband and I stopped at Maggie's on our way from PEI down to Advocate Harbour. The place is on a quiet, pretty, residential street that's just a 3 minute walk to an area with restaurants/a coffee shop. We checked in pretty late, but there were lights left on so we could find her place easily as well as a private entry and keypad for easy access. The place was clean, bigger than we expected, and the bed was comfortable. Maggie responded quickly to my message and helped us with recommendations in town and also in the next place we'd be in. "
17040434,154873460,Sackville,42881,116884753,Catheline,"Une demeure chaleureuse, avec un brin de magie. Une belle énergie émane des lieux, empreints d'une touche rustique et artistique. Il est situé dans un quartier très plaisant pour les promenades tranquilles. Je recommande vivement cet endroit."

17040434,162393750,Sackville,42906,22623954,Bob & Cate,"Maggie's place is a cozy second-floor apartment that is just a short walk to everything we wanted to see and do in Sackville. The outstanding Sackville Waterfowl Park, the main reason for our stay, is less than a block away right behind the house. The apartment is well equipped for cooking and the bed is very, very comfortable. Maggie is a thoughtful host. There were fresh lilacs in the rooms ('tis the season) and very nice original artwork. Maggie provided lots of area information/recommendations and is quick to respond to messages. We will stay again when we are in the area."
17040434,164420775,Sackville,42913,23878627,Ken,Great location and very comfortable! Well equiped with many little amenities.

17040434,167919271,Sackville,42924,114066978,Leigh-Ann,A cute and cozy little apartment in a great location to get to all the major spots in the area. Lots of supplies and extras available for our use which made our stay very comfortable.

17040434,169750429,Sackville,42929,3212168,Alex,"Our stay at Maggie's place was just what we needed - a true five star for all the categories based on our expectations and  needs.<br/><br/>Maggie gave us several great suggestions well ahead of time for places to see in Canada's maritime region. Her place was clean, cute, and just what we needed after camping in Cape Breton. <br/><br/>Sackville is much nicer than Moncton, which really wasn't as friendly though it had more restaurants.  There is a great park near her house where we walked after dinner with our dog. <br/><br/>We would definitely return here if another trip to the Bay of Fundy is in the cards."
17040434,170440966,Sackville,42931,29403343,Philip,"What a great place to stay, perfect location, has all the amenities you can think of, in a Victorian style old home but with modern amenities. Maggie is a great host with excellent communication. Has the rustic but modern feel, very euphoric with the spa feel and high end spa products. Has all utensils, premium coffee/tea, eggs in fridge was a nice touch, and privacy of separate entrance. Wish I could stay longer, every I could wish for in a AirBNB"
17040434,171438507,Sackville,42933,13162842,Stephen,"Maggie's place is very clean, comfortable, quiet apartment located within steps of a great small, artsy college town.   We could not have been happier during our stay here!  The waterfowl marsh, boardwalk and walking paths were fantastic - and located a block from Maggie's place.   All in all, a great and well-decorated apartment - and a great place to stay while exploring this area."
17040434,172502479,Sackville,42937,121856040,Maureen,"Maggie is a gracious host and she goes above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable. Her place is beautiful, comfy cozy and in a great location. Thanks so much Maggie."

17040434,177090887,Sackville,42948,29776011,Krista,Maggie's place was perfect for our night in Sackville! She's got great style but more importantly the apartment was comfortable. Loved that the windows were open when we got there; little touches of lavender throughout did not go unnoticed! She thought of everything really...right down to the communication chalk board :) Totally recommend.

17040434,182444460,Sackville,42961,54786528,Fran,"Maggie's house is charming and in a great location. It is rustic but it had everything you need. Bathroom is renovated and kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook- full fridge, stove, ect. The Sackville Waterfowl park is right around the corner and it is lovely. There are restaurants and a grocery store within walking distance also. Maggie left us some fresh eggs from her chickens which were delicious."
17040434,183556034,Sackville,42964,120631694,Brenda,"Maggie's place is quaint. The space is private. Maggie provides little touches like fresh flowers and eggs from her own chickens. Unfortunately, the stairs were much steeper than we expected. People with mobility issues would have a hard time."
17040434,184406833,Sackville,42966,7611965,Hana,Maggie's place was great and excellent location in Sackville! Was nice to have our own space at such a reasonable price. Would highly recommend!

We felt really relaxed staying here and loved the opportunity to walk to the main street for some groceries and to make our own breakfast. Lots of lovely things nearby and Maggie had thought of all our needs. It isn't a lot of space but it's perfectly suited to 2 people. The decor was nice and homey. There were fresh flowers on the table and fresh eggs in the fridge. Had a great time staying here.
17040434,185775470,Sackville,42969,46590200,Aneesha,"Hi Maggie!<br/><br/>Thank you so much for a lovely stay at your apartment! Although we arrived rather late in the night and were out of the house pretty early in the morning (we were running on a rather tight schedule!), you apartment provided the right amount of comfort for the night! All the amenities were up to expectation and the bed and bath comfortable.  We found your instructions and welcome greetings warm and informative and the art around the house was totally in my taste! Thanks again and wish we had a chance to interact! Cheers!<br/>-Aneesha"
17040434,186137506,Sackville,42970,5067596,Samuel Jeremiah,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Maggie's place! <br/>There was a lot of little details that stood out for us, including: super friendly grey cat, light up signs with messages on them, chalkboard cabinets, tiny animals lining the door sill, sprigs of lavender scattered throughout, motion sensor lights at night to guide your way, etc. <br/>The location is on a quiet street but the nightlife is a quick walk away. <br/>I highly recommend checking her place out!"
17040434,187207160,Sackville,42973,9316888,Vincent,"We really enjoyed our stay in Maggie's apartment. The apartment is rustic and has a lot of character, with a great layout.

17040434,194300774,Sackville,42994,144356253,Nicolas,"Très bien situé, près du centre-ville mignon et intéressant. Jardin et grange à l'arrière, original comme décor. Toutefois, je crois que ce n'est pas fait pour les familles car le logement est petit et les escaliers sont très escarpés et étroits, donc difficile d'y amener autre chose qu'un sac à dos. A besoin d'un peu d'amour, mais peut convenir à un couple pour un arrêt d'une nuit."
17040434,194865888,Sackville,42995,138678261,James,Maggie provides a homely environment with some much appreciated toiletries and her own chickens eggs. Very good value for money.  Sackville is a very cool place you must give it a try!

She clearly brings her gift for color into the space. I love cats too, so the cat greeting committee was incredibly welcome. If a black cat comes up and asks to be petted, I encourage you to follow Petri's suggestion and give him some pats!  The back garden is a riot of wildflowers and the front garden just as full though a bit more structured.  The bed was comfortable and the bath products smelled amazing."

The apartment is a short walk from downtown Sackville with all the small-town charm it has to offer and an even shorter walk to the beautiful waterfowl park, which is perfect for a walk at any time of year.

We would go back again without a second thought."

17040434,315709203,Sackville,43341,154667846,Marissa,Maggie’s apartment might be one of the nicest places I’ve ever had the fortune of staying. I didn’t meet Maggie as I was only there for one night before a long drive home to Ontario but it was exactly what I needed after a week of camping. The whole apartment is beautifully decorated and throughout it has wonderful personal touches that make you feel comfortable right away. Everything you could possibly need for your stay is easily located throughout the house. I only wish I was staying longer rather then one night as Maggie provides a book for the nearby attractions to visit in Sackville.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone.

She's an excellent host and and was great with all communication before we arrived and during our time there.  As lots of guests before have said, there are lovely thoughtful touches throughout the apartment - writing paper in the desk, a fantastic selection of books, basics stocked in the fridge, and lots of pillows and linens.

17040434,458796347,Sackville,43611,221995230,Hugh,"Maggie's place is a wonderfully eclectic and thoughtful space.  You feel like you might be in a century farm in the English countryside but you are in downtown Sackville.  Communication was excellent and our welcome was warm and friendly. The space is well appointed, comfortable fresh linens, great bath with natural products, nice shower, well appointed kitchen, thoughtful touches everywhere (Laughing Whale Coffee, farm fresh eggs, personal decorating touches, small quantities of staples like butter, sugar, creamers and milk for coffee and tea).  The space is quiet and comfortable and we particularly enjoyed our daily visits from Petri the cat knocking at our door. All in all a total winner!  I recommend this space to all visitors!"
17040434,459480381,Sackville,43612,36521532,Sarah,"Due to a death in the family, we were unable to stay at Maggie’s. I can tell you that her preparation for our visit was top notch! Hopefully we can re-book in the future!"
17040434,460940217,Sackville,43615,38116560,Brooke,"Quaint space, with everything you need! Maggie was very quick to respond. Loved the location and the helpful tips about the area."
17040434,462989444,Sackville,43618,52956735,Heather,This was our second stay in the cozy apartment. Maggie is a great host who responds quickly to questions. The location is quiet and within walking distance of downtown Sackville and mount A. Great spot to stay! We would stay here again.
17040434,463988210,Sackville,43620,100397474,Travis,"Maggie's home was comfortable, quiet and full of charm. This space is full of beautiful touches and mosaics. Within a 5 minute walk of everything you need. I was travelling solo for the night but I would take an extended stay at Maggie's with my spouse in a heartbeat."
17040434,465364490,Sackville,43623,64813376,Chelsea,"My boyfriend and I have stayed in Air Bnbs all across Canada, and Maggie’s was by far the best one we’ve stayed at. The nicest homey touches and the perfect size for two people. If ever I’m in the area again, I would choose Maggie’s over a hotel any day. Maggie, thank you again for your suggestions and quick responses. We really enjoyed our stay. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Chelsea"
17040434,468442335,Sackville,43628,18195847,Cindy,Maggie's place is in a lovely neighborhood.  She provided everything I needed for a delightful stay.
17040434,468927594,Sackville,43629,248546454,Marley,"Great host, great location."
17040434,471956267,Sackville,43634,92146888,Kathleen,"The picture of Maggie’s place on airbnb doesn’t sufficiently convey the lovely atmosphere that surrounds the house and property. She has taken care to add many touches that create a lovely feast for the eyes. For me, it immediately felt like home. I’ve stayed at many airbnb’s and Maggie’s is by far the best equipped. I was able to settle in in minutes because it had everything I needed. I’m looking forward to returning sometime."
17040434,474895019,Sackville,43639,36737559,Michelle,"If you're looking for a creative and unique place to stay in a lovely and welcoming town,  this is it. The thoughtful touches like good coffee, fresh flowers, and fresh eggs made our stay a real treat."
17040434,475589228,Sackville,43640,135279568,Barbara,This is a dear little apartment and Maggie provides great coffe and the freshest eggs you'll ever have!<br/>She adds personal touches like ( for us ) fresh lilacs!
17040434,481282696,Sackville,43650,184084943,Gaye,This is our second stay at Maggie’s . . . Doesn’t that say it all?  It is a funky apartment with a hostess who thinks of what it takes to make her guests comfie.  Since our last visit there were some new added touches - love the new phone-charging lamp . . . And Netflix . . .
17040434,483448226,Sackville,43653,43096995,Jeffrey,"Maggie's place is a great find for one or two people! There are lots of charming touches, guides for things to do in Sackville, and overlooks a quaint barn in the back. It's just a few minutes to walk to cafes, bars, shops, and the university. Maggie is a great host and keeps a clean, lovely place for people to stay."
17040434,495785942,Sackville,43672,184084943,Gaye,"This is a comfortable and well equipped place to stay in Sackville.  The location is easy walking distance to the town center, including a terrific bakery, the university and the jewel of Sackville:  the water fowl park.  This was our third stay here."
17040434,500040099,Sackville,43678,159198101,Paul And Carolyn,Maggie is a very well organized host and provides a very nice quaint upper floor that fits two people wonderfully. A great mixture of old charm and modern technology.
17040434,500679338,Sackville,43679,273979989,Leah,"Maggie’s is the cutest little spot! Great location, close to a beautiful nature trail and restaurants as well. The space has everything you need and was our favourite stop on our drive out east! We would stay again in a heart beat and highly recommend!"
17040434,503141940,Sackville,43682,11404005,Kate,"This place was beautiful and each room was quite a bit bigger than I expected. I stayed with my toddler and we had lots of space, it was a 4 minute walk to get to coffee or to visit the ducks in the park. Maggie was incredible, she found a button that had popped off one of my skirts and returned it to me! I would highly recommend for anyone visiting sackville!"
17040434,504387146,Sackville,43684,7952077,Amelia,"My partner and I stayed here for a couple of nights during a road trip from Toronto to Halifax, as this spot was a close distance to both Hopewell Rocks and Halifax. We'd love to be able to come back and make Sackville the vacation destination sometime instead We could have easily spent a week in that space and that town.<br/><br/>We've stayed in several charming and cozy Airbnbs, but this is the best one yet. So many personal touches made this place both unique and welcoming, from the chalkboard displaying a personalized message, to the lit up signs providing important information (about cats and coffee!), to the tiny animals above the kitchen doorframe.<br/><br/>It's not just a pretty spot to lay your head, though, and all the amenities needed for a stay were provided. Most importantly, the bed is soooooo comfortable, and the coffee is great!<br/><br/>Bonus: the chickens in the backyard and the waterfowl park just beyond it offer a lovely morning serenade. At night, all is quiet. We slept so well after very long days.<br/><br/>We wish we could have spent more time in Sackville as it looks like the perfect little town for us. Downtown includes a movie theatre, bookstore, music store, and several tasty looking eateries. The host provided a detailed list of places in the area to check out, but we were only able to try the recommended pizza (Napale) and coffee (The Black Duck), both of which were amazing.<br/><br/>We really hope to make it back to properly experience Sackville, and we'll definitely stay here when we do!"
17040434,505623844,Sackville,43686,97655040,Nicholas,"Maggie's place is hands-down one of the coolest and cutest Airbnb's we have ever stayed at. The apartment essentially backs right on to Waterfowl park (a great place for a stroll or a run), and is super close to the main street. <br/><br/>The place is rife with personal touches and the space itself is cozy and well-decorated. Although unavailable while we were there, Maggie did inform me that she often offers fresh eggs from her chickens to guests (so cool), and there are a couple of cats around to keep you company. <br/><br/>All in all, I cannot say enough positive things about this place. Not only would  I stay here again, but I actively want to stay here."
17040434,508902933,Sackville,43690,32608856,Maria,"Maggie has a great location, a block from town and adjacent to a large bird sanctuary. We had concerns about the steep staircase but our 13YO dog handled  them fine. Fort Beausejour nearby has a great history and is worth a visit."
17040434,509503833,Sackville,43691,142611279,Bradie,"Such an awesome space and perfect for two. Bed was extremely comfortable, the personalized message was so thoughtful and it was so close to the park and some gems of restaurants and coffee shops!  If back in Sackville, I will definitely hit up Maggie again!!"
17040434,515907717,Sackville,43700,166701072,Pearl,"We had a wonderful stay at Maggie’s! The place was clean and very stylish, and her recommendations were right on the money."
17040434,517455344,Sackville,43702,117273921,Anna-Beth,"A wonderful place full of stylish touches and thoughtful charm! I would highly recommend anyone to stay here, especially if you like kitties!"
17040434,518443377,Sackville,43703,138402721,Susanne,Unique spot

17040434,522749952,Sackville,43710,17553499,Kim,A great location to walk to downtown. We appreciated the coffee especially! Maggie is a communicative and thoughtful host. Many thanks!
17040434,523836506,Sackville,43712,242557300,Margaret,"Great location close to Trans Canada. There is a waterfowl sanctuary with boardwalks a couple of minutes away. Comfortable, well equipped  apt with a unique, arty vibe. Maggie is a thoughtful,  unobtrusive host. Two very charming cats come up to visit if you open the door for them. Dark, narrow stairs could be an issue for some."
17040434,524785370,Sackville,43714,10673633,Karim,My wife and I stayed one night at Maggie's lovely apartment. It was absolutely perfect! We highly recommend.
17040434,526083555,Sackville,43716,40674582,Abirami,Even though I did not stay in Maggie's place and had to cancel due to Hurricane Dorian. She was amazing since the time I booked with a warm welcome message and regular updates till the day of our stay. Hopefully will stay in your place next time we visit Sackville.
17040434,526828734,Sackville,43717,3189356,Carolyn,"Maggie's place is super cute and in a great location in Sackville, very closeto the downtown area. It was quiet and comfortable, and Maggie was a great host. She was very welcoming and quick to respond, and we would definitely stay again!"
17040434,527301015,Sackville,43718,23225074,Don,nice place but steep stairs
17040434,528201430,Sackville,43720,604081,Irene,Maggie is the most genuinely friendly hostess ever.  Loved her place where we felt at home immediately.<br/>The fresh eggs she left us were the best ever.<br/>The Water fowl park was very entertaining.<br/>If we're ever way up North again we will definitely stay  at Maggie's.
17040434,528658606,Sackville,43721,293486216,Maria,"Great place to stay! Cozy apartment with lovely bedroom and comfortable bed. Very easy to access, great location. Cats are absolutely adorable! I will definitely stay again."

17040434,542495608,Sackville,43744,236826901,Kathryn,"Quaint, spacious apartment close to downtown and the Waterfowl Park. <br/>Great host - easy and fast communication."
17040434,544185181,Sackville,43747,269505478,Lucas,"This place is so cool! Well decorated, well stocked, and well lived in, I settled in to place immediately. I stayed at Maggie’s place at the end of a 3 week trip and it was the only place that felt more like home than a place I was staying. The cat is friendly, but will stay out of your space if you would prefer. I absolutely recommend this spot in Sackville."
17040434,547082402,Sackville,43752,288543028,Michael,Great location. Super clean. Would stay again!
17040434,550196992,Sackville,43756,4900912,Sandra,"Perfect Sackville Stay.  Maggie’s space is so cute.  Super comfy bed, excellent water pressure and temperature, super quiet, loads of extra touches. And a super friendly cat..if you want it there.  I loved it!  Maggie was so prompt and friendly in her correspondence with me.  Location super convenient to town."
17040434,553185199,Sackville,43761,207346889,Guinevere,"Absolutely beautiful spot, quaint, well decorated, super cozy and walking distance from everything!"

17040434,558154277,Sackville,43771,68581643,Bryn,"My stay at Maggie's place was fantastic. Everything I needed was there. Very close to Mt. Allison U, would recommend to anyone!"
17040434,559627783,Sackville,43773,13282062,Scott,"Nestled on the second floor of this classic Sackville home is a cozy (yes, small) perfect spot for 1-2 people if you are visiting the area or your kids at Mount Allison University. Everything you need - comfortable bed, great shower, kitchen and a place to crash - all there AND its a 3 minute walk to the main strip and 6 minute walk to campus. Communication and check in was very easy. Space was perfect. I will be encouraging other MTA parents and fans to use this spot!"
17040434,562885651,Sackville,43780,58475688,Jelaina,"We had a lovely stay at Maggie’s place! It was a quaint apartment, with cute decor and thoughtful touches, such as an essential oil diffuser. We didn’t stay long so didn’t have a chance to take advantage of her local tips, but she did provide quite a few. The place wasn’t completely soundproof, but was in great condition given the age of the house, with both original and modern features."
17040434,565458818,Sackville,43786,240505912,Jillian,"Cute, cozy and private little apartment. We felt at home and welcomed. Conveniently located. Maggie had local restaurants and activities highlighted on a map so everything was easy to find. We would absolutely stay there again."

17040434,571725389,Sackville,43800,66600890,Zoe,"Beautifully designed space, with personalized touches, in a great part of town! Maggie's place has everything you need for a perfect stay in Sackville. Minutes to downdown, with access to the waterfowl park nearby as well.  Communication was excellent throughout, and check-in was a breeze."
17040434,574718148,Sackville,43807,53463004,Jessy,"10/10, would recommend. <br/>Beautifully decorated and perfect location."
17040434,577513822,Sackville,43814,308683545,Jenny,Maggie’s place is so unique and well done. It is comfortable and she has thought of everything. I would highly recommend her place. It’s like a hotel with more character and half the price
17040434,581650218,Sackville,43824,85621593,Rachel,This is such a cute little place. It was perfect for my partner and I to stay the night in Sackville. Thanks!
17040434,587005433,Sackville,43832,308962689,Paul,"This is the GEM of Sackville! We were 250 meters from the in-laws, we could walk, the main street is very close. (restaurants, cafes, thrift shop bar)<br/><br/>Everything you could think of was there - TV, Fridge full of fresh oranges, butter, creamers - cupboards full of spices, coffee, sugar, teas of all kinds...Dishes, kettle, cups and loads of cookware~!<br/><br/>Heating was amazing and it's a bright little place.<br/><br/>The Bathroom is supplied with great soaps, towels, hand cloths,  mega toilet paper etc...<br/><br/>Comfortable bed, Queen Size, sheets and a great duvet!<br/><br/>If you need to stay in Sackville (Mt Allison University folks!), this is the place - Great for 2 people!"
17040434,590070693,Sackville,43837,5834383,Janna,"Maggie's place is a cozy, cute and styln' home away from home. I stayed here for 3 days and i wanted to stay forever. Lots of thoughtful touches to make you feel right at home. Visits from a friendly cat named Petri were a bonus. If you're allergic, you could deny him entrance..but i was more than happy to have a cat to cuddle with! I will be back, Petri."
17040434,592997108,Sackville,43844,69865919,Marnie,Maggie was awesome! Loved this sweet suite!

17040434,601818299,Sackville,43865,308755527,Sophie,"Parfait emplacement! Belle décoration, mais c'est mal isolé, donc on entend toutes les conversations des voisins."
17040434,603666932,Sackville,43870,71399983,Eric,Great spot. Highly recommended.
17040434,605467243,Sackville,43875,14950563,Cheryl,Had a lovely stay at Maggie’s. I will definitely be back! (Also loves the cat - he is a real charmer!)
17040434,605935694,Sackville,43876,299750673,Suzanne,"A wonderful little spot in the heart of Sackville. The little apartment is really cute and very comfortable to stay in. Love the welcome notes, and special little notes throughout. Bed VERY comfy and the place is just right for a single or couple traveling in the area."
17040434,607303857,Sackville,43878,148059951,Naomi,"Maggie's place is perfect for a quick stay in Sackville. It feels homely, and has lots of thoughtful touches to make it feel extra special, like essential oils in the bathroom and additional comforts like blankets and netflix in the bedroom! There are books and local guides to enjoy and the kitchen has everything you could possibly need. Great location for walking into town for something to eat, and Maggie communicated efficiently and gave us all the information we needed."
17040434,613072320,Sackville,43891,4900912,Sandra,"This is my second stay at Maggie’s.  I was wondering if it would be a little chilly in the winter, but was completely wrong.  Come up the stairs and enter into a cozy, warm suite.  The warmth comes from the main house and there are three Esperanto units in the suite that can be controlled within the suite. On the nights it snowed, I liked keeping the bedroom curtain open a bit peek out at the flakes. <br/><br/>Location is absolutely perfect for walking around Sackville. So close to the restaurants, cafes, bars, bookstore, grocery store etc!<br/><br/> Maggie replies really quickly and is super helpful.<br/><br/>Thanks Maggie. ( hugs to Petri)"
17040434,616409411,Sackville,43899,185172762,Susan,"Thank you so much Maggie for your wonderful hospitality. Your home had everything we needed, including great coffee and was very stylish. We loved the fresh eggs. Petri the cat was too sweet for words and stayed with me all morning. Thanks again for everything :)<br/>Take care,<br/>Susan"
17040434,616976567,Sackville,43901,182078560,Mieke,"Wonderful apartment with lots of thoughtful, homey touches. Maggie is easy to communicate with and provided a book full of local tips and sights to see. Her cat Petri is a gem! Thanks for the amazing hospitality!"
17040434,621033238,Sackville,43917,33916761,Tristanne,Maggie is a great host!  I felt very welcome.  Her responses are always timely and she offers so much information and help.  She recommends places to eat that are delicious.  The space is comfy and quaint. I will definitely stay here again.
17040434,625261843,Sackville,43969,27694376,Sophie,"We stayed at Maggie's place due to some complications with work due to Covid-19 and it was perfect. Cosy space, great recommendations, quick responses and the cutest cat, Petri. If we're ever back in Sackville we'll be sure to stay with Maggie & Petri!"
17040434,630576840,Sackville,44001,95474723,Irene,"I stayed at the place for a month and it was a very comfortable stay. The unit has everything you need to feel like home. A very pleasant park is only one minute walk and and a grocery store only 20 min walk.  Unfortunately because of Covid I was not able to enjoy eating out and cannot recommend any place, although Maggie has a great guide on where to go and is very responsive to all messages. Overall the place is very nice and I would consider it again if I need to stay in that area."
17040434,634536717,Sackville,44016,60493592,Andrea,"A very comfy spot in a central location. There were a lot of thoughtful little extras to make the apartment more welcoming and comfortable which was appreciated. I loved the cozy Maritime vibe of the space. Thank you for your hospitality, Maggie."
17040434,636199082,Sackville,44021,20068855,Jim,"This place is very nice and centrally located to the University, the waterfowl park, and the restaurants in town.  As I am not normally a cat person- the feline was a pleasant addition.  If you do not wish to have a ""comfort"" animal, then it is easy enough to control the cat's presence.   The place is extremely functional and well laid out.  I will caution that if you are much taller than my 5' 7"" tall, the pitched/slanted roof will pose a in a few specific areas."
17040434,637809137,Sackville,44025,231174774,Bianca,"Maggie is as sweet as they come. She really knew how to make the space feel like home, only better. There was lots of room for us and our dog. My favorite thing was the location, right in the middle of town."
17040434,640012050,Sackville,44031,160442294,Jayson,"Maggie's wàs a quaint, eclectic, cozey space. Ideally located close to shops and nature. Would stay there again."

17040434,663278389,Sackville,44086,247090059,Monique,"I had a great stay at  “Staghorne Suite”.  The space is lovely, homey, quiet, relaxing and very clean. Anything one could have needed was readily available and the added bonus (for me) was a few visits from the resident cat- Petri! <br/>“Staghorne Suite” is conveniently located near MtA University as well as within walking distance to several of Sackville’s restaurants, and amenities. Maggie, the host, is very responsive to messages which I appreciated. I most definitely will be back for another stay."
17040434,715881824,Sackville,44181,24932990,Jon,Great two-week solo stay. Maggie is very helpful. Petri’s visits were a pleasant bonus. Spotless bathroom- and I’m PICKY in that department. <br/>-K.

17040434,746783872,Sackville,44294,220632586,Jim,A well appointed space that works well for quarantining. Walking distance to shops and a walking trail.
17040434,4.24481E+17,Sackville,44416,392882604,Katherine,"This is a great suite in an ideal location.  Maggie is an absolutely marvelous hostess, caring and gracious, and very quick to respond to any questions or issues you might have. Very clear communication. We rented the suite for an extended stay for a family member, and it was perfect for her. One appliance needed a repair during that time, and Maggie took care of it immediately. Downstairs cat often came to visit, making it feel even more home-like, but Maggie was open to ways to keep the cat away for anyone who has allergies or does not want the visits, evidence of her being accomodating and putting guest needs first.  (Our family member welcomed the cat.)  We would not hesitate to stay with Maggie again."

The furniture also comfortable; don't get me started on the bed...I wanted to stay in it forever! Amazing combination of vintage and modern. It was just a short walk to everything you could want in Sackville as well. What are those things? Maggie has it all mapped out for you (literally) in her info packet in the apartment, if you have questions, she is happy to make recommendations personally. <br/><br/>She is also super communicative!! Anything you need to ask or talk to her about, she answers your messages quite quickly. <br/><br/>There was nothing she hasn't thought of. So well thought out, from the main things anyone would look for, right down to little details you might not have thought of but are so glad they are there.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to everything, is quaint, quiet, scrumptiously comfy, makes your stay easy and pleasant, stop looking!

The stairs to the apartment are startlingly steep/narrow, so be aware if you have any mobility issues, but the place is well worth the climb!"

17040434,6.48493E+17,Sackville,44725,381976033,Lee,"What a lovely place to stay this was.  Gorgeous and imaginatively decorated bo-ho style, and lovely welcoming touches like fresh flowers - and eggs from Maggie's chickens. I couldn't have asked for a more peaceful place, as the Sackville Waterfowl Park is about a minute from the door. Also - importantly - WiFi lightening fast with no issues at all.<br/><br/>The apartment is on a quiet street within easy walking distance to town, where you can find great little restaurants, the library, post office, art galleries, a cinema, two banks - even a great supermarket.  If you've never been to Sackville, you're in for a real treat.<br/><br/>Maggie is a lovely and generous host, and very communicative. I especially loved Petri, the cat, who kept me company.  I really miss this place, and will definitely stay again when I come back into the area.  Can't recommend highly enough."
17040434,6.57157E+17,Sackville,44737,324723183,Jonathan,"This place was fantastic!  Private side entrance includes motion activated lights in the hallway and on each stair step.  Cool!  Maggie was kind enough to provide fresh ground coffee and the 2 pitchers of cold water in the refrigerator were great after a long drive.  She also has an excellent house manual full of wonderful local restaurant and trail recommendations.  But our favorite part was the 3 bag waste sorting instructions (compost, recycling and trash.). Maggie even provides a container for each.  Wow!  Comfortable bed and we loved the wall-mounted TV with a guest Netflix account.  Stove is older but works well.  We also used the basement washer and dryer and both were awesome.  We communicated via text during our stay and Maggie was very responsive."
17040434,6.60102E+17,Sackville,44741,128977352,Alan,A lovely small apartment very close to both the Main Street and the bird sanctuary. I found it perfect for what I needed and enjoyed my stay there very much.

17040434,8.15259E+17,Sackville,44955,201846378,Dory,"Maggie's place genuinely made me feel immediately at home--I was sad to leave! It's full of lovely touches that give it the feeling of a home, but with the cleanliness and convenience of a hotel.  I wished I had more time to just hang out and read the interesting books in Maggie's library! The apartment is not large, but the way it's divided allowed my partner to hold Zoom meetings from the kitchen while I played with our 18-month toddler in the bedroom without any problem. The location could not be better: right next to the Waterfowl park, and around the corner from Bridge St shops and Mount Allison. I would definitely stay at Maggie's next time I'm in Sackville!"

It has everything you need for the perfect stay; from the candles/diffusers, to the games, it creates an atmosphere that feels like home away from home.  We also loved our visit from Petri and enjoyed the fresh eggs. The location is ideal with just a short walk to the town's many treasures (the beautiful waterfowl park, cafes, restaurants and shops). We would definitely recommend Maggie's for the perfect getaway!"
17040434,8.34818E+17,Sackville,44982,152360041,Julie,"My stay at Maggie’s place was wonderful! What was intended as a pitstop before and after a graduation, turned into an unexpected, much needed, cozy getaway. A++ comfort and care in every detail. Thank you Maggie!"

The apartment is a wonderful combination of old home charm and stylish trendy furnishings. It is above a store so it was wonderful not to feel like our baby crying in the night would disturb anyone.

We were in town for a wedding at the music barn outside of Sackville which was a short 8 minute taxi ride from the apartment. The space was beautifully decorated and had small touches like coffee, tea, a light breakfast and an easy to use Netflix. We would definitely stay again and recommend these hosts to our friends. "

The apartment was spotless and very comfortable to hang out in with plenty of space. Three bedrooms! Two bath rooms!  Our  daughter likes to bake so the kitchen was a big plus. This was a great place to stay!

Beds are super comfortable and it’s really quiet and lots of nearby shops, eateries and a Saturday market. Enjoyed the added touches by hosts, like coffee, extra blankets and pillows, towels and plants (I loved one so much, had to visit Blooms to buy the same one). Home away from home, if ever back in Sackville I will be back at the ABNB."

26368479,500719322,Sackville,43679,187464215,David,"Haidee & Trudy’s place was beautiful. They’ve definitely taken their stunning store and carried it into the upstairs apartment. There was breakfast food in the fridge when we got there (eggs, bread, pancake mix, milk, cream, coffee and tea). They also left a couple local beers which was an awesome surprise. Great location near cafe’s and restaurants and only 30 minutes from Moncton. They answered all of our questions quickly and made sure we had everything we needed. We could not have asked for better accommodations. I highly recommend staying here! Thanks for hosting us. All the best!"

26368479,506368096,Sackville,43687,248500803,Megan,"A beautifully appointed apartment. Spacious and decorated so nicely. Grocery store, dollar store, restaurants and pharmacy on the same block. Great for a family, the kids didn’t have to share a room! I didn’t realize it didn’t have AC but thankfully it was a cooler couple of days. Lots of windows to open and window fans compensate. Bit of noise from the patio next door.  Lovely stay and lovely shop on the main floor."
26368479,511615830,Sackville,43694,20366529,Margarita,"Haydee/Trudy's place was perfect for our visit to Sackville... a short walk from the waterfowl park, bakeries, restaurants and bookstores... as well as a short driving distance to Johnson's Mills.  We also took day trips to Mary' Point and Alma on the other side of the Bay of Fundy as well as to Nova Scotia.<br/><br/>As an in town location the only challenge was the noise level one evening from an outside party at Joey's (which by the way, has the best pizza ever!).  Once we closed the window's on that side of the apartment and turned on the window fans however, we slept soundly and forgot about the party. Coming from living in the woods the town noises took some adjustment on our part, but it was all well worth it and we are are hoping to use it again during our next visit.<br/><br/>The beds were super comfy and the shower nice and hot. A family of 3 joined us at the end of the week and there was plenty of room for everyone.<br/><br/>Lots of personal touches and essentials that made our stay enjoyable and made us feel cared for."

26368479,528700679,Sackville,43721,264794908,Jean,"Blooms was the perfect home base for our family while assisting parents with a house move in Sackville. We were able to enjoy all the comforts of home at Blooms for three days and avoid the stress of living amongst unpacked boxes. The place was big enough for us all to have bedroom privacy yet still enjoy meals in the homey kitchen and living area. The fresh flowers were lovely. Breakfast food items, coffee and tea that were provided meant we could start the day in a leisurely way. Easy communication and check-in/out. Haidee/Trudy ensured that all our needs were met. We will return in future when visiting family in Sackville."

The location allowed us to spend the whole weekend travelling by foot or bike. Terrific restaurants minutes away. An added bonus was that we were above a wonderful  and popular local business. Spending the weekend above a flower and plant shop was perfect for us. We kept heading down to see what other treasures we could find.

The plants located all around the the unit and the light shining through the many windows filled the place with a pleasant energy throughout the day. <br/><br/>We found some great  food nearby as well! We tried out Joey’s Pizza and Aida’s Café (great coffee). Beds at Blooms’s has everything you need to live comfortably with for any duration of time - there’s even a laundromat about 30 seconds walking distance away. We’ll be planning to come back sometime soon! Thanks Bloom’s.

Trudy and Haidee were always quick to answer our questions and gave us some great tips on local events.  We were very sorry to leave our little home above the flower shop!"
26368479,6.5793E+17,Sackville,44738,138004323,Ben,"Very clean and spacious apartment with two bathrooms. Photos do not give it enough credit in terms of space. Location is the heart of downtown sackville but far enough away from the nightlife to be disturbed. Host was fantastic, very friendly."

Close to all downtown restaurants and bars, right next to the main city park with a splash pad and playground for kids, and just down the road from the university. The apartment is much larger than we expected and had a ton of space for our young kids to run around and enjoy themselves. Great communication from the hosts, both prior to check in and throughout our stay. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to any family looking for a great place in Sackville!"

28258068,325378037,Sackville,43362,15076393,Cynthia,"A step into history and back in time, but with modern updates. This sweet apartment is lovely. Sparkling clean, well equipped, private… tastefully decorated with period pieces. The comfortable bed even has a down mattress topper. <br/><br/>We didn’t have the time to explore the walking trail but it looked inviting."
28258068,326534298,Sackville,43365,15315141,Leanne,"This is a beautiful apartment - we were thrilled to get a chance to stay in such an interesting historical building. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but not far off - and well worth the short drive from the highway. There are some really cool touches in the apartment like the counter surface of the island, which is made from an old bowling alley lane. The location is absolutely serene and I loved seeing the moon and stars at night out the window. Amy and Jeff took great care to make sure we were taken care of - thanks for the stay and for sharing your home with us."
28258068,327143238,Sackville,43366,81466303,Cayley,"A truly beautiful and spacious apartment. Amy was always quick to respond and had many great suggestions for the area, as well as hiking suggestions in Nova Scotia. It was a bit creepy pulling up to the massive school house later in the evening, since we were the only ones inside, but the apartment itself was so lovely and clean with large windows, thoughtful and meaningful touches, a binder with all the info you could need during your stay, and the softest sheets and blankets on the bed. It was a good stopover point when traveling from Cape Breton to Quebec City. I’m sure it would be a great home base for anyone looking to explore some of Nova Scotia/ P.E.I. On our way out we stopped at the Black Duck cafe for coffee which was v good. Wish we had more time to explore the town itself. Amy and Jeff are excellent hosts."
28258068,329698925,Sackville,43372,216895307,Rachel,Such a unique getaway!

28258068,331754284,Sackville,43376,216293574,Lucyna,"This is an amazing place for Mount A parents (and others visiting Sackville) to stay. I highly recommend it. My daughter is in her 2nd year and during midterms, I arrived (beginning of October) to prepare some nourishing meals that she could freeze and use during her midterms. The kitchen in this place is stocked with great cooking equipment. It is a charming and comfortable setting and the hosts are very accessible and responsive. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks to Amy and Jeff for making available this historic and pragmatic setting."
28258068,332155233,Sackville,43377,44300355,Cindy,"In just a few words.....easy, clean and comfortable!  Really nostalgic place to stay!"

28258068,341691299,Sackville,43400,66349008,John,"The location is excellent. We were disappointed in the state of cleanliness of the apartment. There were hairballs in the bathroom and large dust bunnies throughout the rest of the apartment. When we contacted the owner their response was that they would mention it to the cleaners next time which didn't help us at all. We then spent our time sweeping and cleaning the apartment. The apartment has very large floor to ceiling windows but there are no curtains on any windows. Going to the bathroom, getting changed or going to bed was quite a public display especially with houses right across the road."
28258068,346134330,Sackville,43411,8804049,Kathy,The loft is bright and open with an eclectic decorating style that matches the location! The hosts were welcoming and helpful!

The apartment feels twice it’s size and full of light from the high lofted ceiling and tall windows. Beautiful building outside and lovely area, just off the grid of Sackville. Quick and easy check-in and out. Only recommendation I would leave is a few curtains for the bathroom and the bed area. Thank you again!"
28258068,349139109,Sackville,43420,8361496,Payam,"Unique spot in a converted school house. Renovated tastefully for comfort and with all the essentials. The windows are quite big and bright making the place airy - but there are no curtains so just be aware. It didn’t bother me but I could see it making others uncomfortable. Overall, I’d definitely stay here again!"

I never wanted to leave. gorgeous apartment, cozy bed, everything you need for cooking. The hosts we're so sweet and helped us jump start our car when the battery died. sackville on it's own is such a charming place, but this air bnb would be worth the trip all by itself. hope to be back soon."

It was quiet, bright (even on the day of a snowstorm), and warm. The bed was comfortable - I had three perfect sleeps. Amy was quick to reply when I was wondering about snow removal after the storm (which was done within hours of the storm’s end and well ahead of when I was leaving). I would highly recommend this spot and I am looking for time in my calendar to go back!"

Truly a fabulous mix of shabby chic decor & preservation of the integrity of the century old building. The kitchen is fully stocked, the kitchen sink & shower have great water pressure, & the entire apartment was sparking clean. Really just an overall awesome, quiet place to stay. My husband and I only spent 2 nights, but wish we could have stayed longer! Thanks Amy & Jeff!"

28258068,461474515,Sackville,43616,260055077,Victoria,"You can expect a beautiful  clean space, the best feature is the open concept layout and updated rustic charm. Its a blissful feeling to wake up and have light pouring through the massive windows. One of the top/coolest hidden gems I've been to."

28258068,479087906,Sackville,43646,27166185,Jim,A large space to spread out in. Every thing worked. Screens on windows had no holes. Heat worked. Had every thing we needed. Even found a pair of scissors - just like in all school rooms. Thanks!
28258068,482532948,Sackville,43652,33315145,Chad,We were obsessed with 10 School Lane and were sad not to have booked for two nights. The space is so charming and roomy with amazing morning light and lots of windows to check out the scenery. Would absolutely recommend this space to friends.
28258068,483585651,Sackville,43653,38540545,Jean,"The loft is a wonderful large space with 16 foot ceilings and 10 foot high windows. The light is amazing, the WiFi is fast, and it has all the amenities. Please add a real lock to the second entrance door and it will be perfect."
28258068,488730790,Sackville,43661,35845451,Steve,It was lovely to stay in Amy and Jeffs character apartment it had everything we needed. The light coming through the long windows made it so bright and glorious. Also the peacefulness of the location was a bonus. We used the rail trail close by for some walks and also visited the bay of Fundy. All in all a very pleasant week and would love to come back again.
28258068,489878159,Sackville,43663,112736374,Natalie,Love the privacy and the character of the old school house!
28258068,491648526,Sackville,43666,1685254,Lauren,"The space at the schoolhouse is just as shown in the photos, bright and airy. And the location is really amazing for walking, or even driving into Sackville, which is a neat little town! Everything was clean and spacious. Would definitely return."
28258068,492755058,Sackville,43667,97698776,Samuel,Great loft! The open air concept is quite remarkable. The windows allowed for so much sunlight to come in that the place felt even grander than the pictures show! I loved my stay.

28258068,512605350,Sackville,43695,279716904,Sharon,Great open space.   Very clean and bright.  Truly a unique location.
28258068,515252324,Sackville,43699,39389645,Richard,"A different experience in an old school house. Some will love it, some will not. Everything is old inside including furniture and amenities. What was not expected is that the building is being used by others as some kind of learning facility. Value for money but you get what you pay for."
28258068,516554418,Sackville,43701,264346442,Melissa,A gorgeous and unique location in a beautiful quaint small town. Great hosts easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend!
28258068,517452957,Sackville,43702,225610691,Caissie,Beautiful place and very clean! Minutes away from park and popular wedding venue! Hosts were easy to communicate with and responded quickly!
28258068,519429145,Sackville,43705,27362755,James,"A very unique property to check out, truly enjoyed our stay with the large windows, the bright space, lots of character."
28258068,523435598,Sackville,43711,159347245,Leah,"This place was a cool experience. Beautiful bucolic scenery - at first we were a little freaked out, because you're in this huge school by yourself at night, but it ended up being a lovely place to stay. The bed is super comfy and the place is decorated with super cute antique touches like a huge cast iron farmhouse sink, antique furniture, and a clawfoot tub!"
28258068,524255866,Sackville,43713,57232821,Susan,"The loft apartment is so cool! We only stayed one night, but enjoyed the space immensely. The large windows allow so much natural light into the space - it was a treat to sit and relax with coffee in the morning. A wonderful use of an old historic building."
28258068,530896895,Sackville,43724,40736224,Kelly,"We had a lovely, serene fall weekend here. As others have said, this place is a destination in itself! The studio is thoughtfully set up and full of beautiful, idiosyncratic touches - from antique furniture to more contemporary, offbeat artwork, and a diverse library. It feels comfortable and like home, even if you're just here briefly. The place fills up with sunlight and the breeze that comes through is so refreshing. It's a bit far from Sackville's main area, but the walk over is enjoyable and the lovely trail you can take for much of the way is so worth your time. Amy was fantastically communicative - kind and quick in her responses. We'll absolutely be returning next time we're in Sackville!"
28258068,532864060,Sackville,43728,27166707,Barry,The loft apartment was a lovely quiet space. The road to the apartment is a great location for a quiet stay. Downtown Sackville is very quaint. Enjoyed our stay!
28258068,533358541,Sackville,43729,48793683,Danette,This is an unbelievable space with tons of character.  It’s almost like stepping back in time yet still having modern amenities.  It was very tastefully decorated and would highly recommend staying here.  It was within walking distance of downtown and only a 20 minute drive to the Bay of Fundy.
28258068,535482066,Sackville,43732,60412132,Ted,"The most unique Airbnb stay we have ever experienced. The loft itself is spectacular, but the setting is what makes it fantastic. This place is encased within a historic building that still echoes from a bygone era. It's an inspired space."
28258068,535934883,Sackville,43733,28174961,Mike,"Wow! What an amazing place! We absolutely loved our short stay at The Old Schoolhouse. The building is amazing, the space is amazing, the apartment is amazing. The kitchen is really well stocked too, I think we could have made a meal just from what was in the store cupboards! :-) Thank you for a great stay in one of the best Airbnb’s we have ever stayed in."
28258068,537376646,Sackville,43736,27106591,Nancy,Beautiful loft in a historic building with antique furnishings yet modern amenities. Lots of character and warmth. Very close to town if you have a car/bike. Wish we’d had stayed longer to enjoy the property and surrounding trails and beach etc.
28258068,539048453,Sackville,43738,163586563,Lisa,"A large, comfortable space with thoughtful touches including antiques, books, and a well appointed kitchen.  We loved it!<br/><br/>I couldn’t suggest any improvements, it is beyond good. <br/><br/>Thank you, Jeff!"

28258068,551803470,Sackville,43758,280771923,Juliana,"The school house was charming, clean, private and very affordable.  It is a sunlit room with a beautiful view.  If you like soaking in the bath you will love the claw footed tub.  The only thing I found inconvenient is not having an outlet in the bath room for a hairdryer but i would highly recommend this place for a quiet get away."
28258068,553177579,Sackville,43761,124126498,Lou,So... i was thinking of leaving a bad comment just so people wouldn’t want to go and this place can stay a hidden secret gem... But... that would really make me a total mean person ! <br/><br/>This place is just wonderful... the vintage look and warmth of the loft. The people of the town. The scenery when you drive around. The hosts were so helpful and quick at answering all the questions i had. Easy check in. Easy check out. 12 stars on 10 ⭐️👌🏼
28258068,553568521,Sackville,43762,82124214,Andrew,"Jeff’s place is great! It’s a beautiful loft, great location, lots of space. I’d recommend this place to anyone and everyone."
28258068,554477990,Sackville,43764,268448038,Brian,"It's a bit of a shock to drive up to a massive building that looks abandoned in the dark. But seriously, you will not be disappointed! It is one of the most unique, cute places you will find! The antique decor adds the finishing touches to a beautiful place."
28258068,559630838,Sackville,43773,66523542,Anita,"My partner and I had a marvellous time staying in the old schoolhouse. The space is beautiful, very well-equipped with everything you will need for a relaxing time. The space was very clean, super bright, and decorated beautifully. I felt totally comfortable and ""at home"". We were stunned as we walked in - just the perfect spot! I highly recommend staying here - and plan to stay longer than you need! We loved it so much that we stayed an extra two days. <br/>Enjoy! And thanks again."

It’s a beautiful apartment with lots of character and history of the building included. It’s such a bright and charming space. The claw foot tub is a great bonus.

Great for a couple or single. Comfy couch was handy as bed is a bit small but dreamy. Host was quick to respond to a few hiccups and the entire experience was super for our overnight in Amherst."

28258068,4.09359E+17,Sackville,44395,178212647,Nicholas,Amazing place full of character. We stayed there for our wedding weekend and it was the perfect place to coordinate and get ready because it was so spacious. Waking up to the birds chirping in the morning is also a big plus.

28258068,4.62983E+17,Sackville,44469,72217366,Rich,"Yes, this is a 1900's classroom. The ceilings must be a lot of centimeters high.  Huge windows overlook a small forest separating the schoolhouse from the ex-railroad walking path that stretches for kilometers in either direction. This is one of those gems you can find on Airbnb, sometimes. This IS SOMETIMES!"
28258068,4.68802E+17,Sackville,44477,41988669,Deb,"This is an outstanding place - beautifully restored, open and spacious. Host left coffee and sent me great tips about the area, including info about a trail steps away. I never would have found it on my own so that info was much appreciated."

Nothing's far from anything in Bagtown, but Jeff's spot gives you the quiet comfort of country living, with plenty of amenities nearby."
28258068,6.12956E+17,Sackville,44676,120378800,Noel,"Beautiful place. High ceilings, tons of space, Incredible natural light. Very quiet. Trans Canada Trail next door. Definitely would stay again. Loved it."
28258068,6.60074E+17,Sackville,44741,18898669,Kara,This is an interesting space a bit off the beaten path but close to town. High ceilings and bright light. Nicely appointed. Bring a sleep mask! <br/><br/>The parking and entrance are a bit rustic but don’t be deterred. <br/><br/>Very nice space to set up for a few days if you need to be in the Sackville area.
28258068,6.62995E+17,Sackville,44745,40736224,Kelly,"This was our second stay in the School House, and just like the first, it was absolutely wonderful. The space is truly incomparable - open, spacious,  teeming with sunlight, full of furniture, art, and objects with rich history an character.<br/><br/>Best of all, much care and attention to detail has been placed into crafting an environment where you can feel like you're at home. If you like to cook while you're traveling, you'll have no problems doing so here - the kitchen is fully functional and has all the basics you need to prepare a meal. <br/><br/>Fredette was kind, responsive, and attentive - communication was easy and she made us feel very taken care of. Thank you so much!"
28258068,6.76769E+17,Sackville,44764,460033492,Vivian,This is a true gem of a place. Bright and airy and old rustic feel. We loved our 5 night stay in Sackville. Close to many sites and beautiful beaches. Definitely would come back. Hosts are amazing and helpful.
28258068,6.83293E+17,Sackville,44773,126182296,Jan,"We loved staying at the old school house. Jeff and Fredette have created a lovely, comfortable space. The loft is really beautiful; gorgeous hardwood floors, tall ceilings (~16 foot), huge window on two sides with beautiful views, a comfortable bed and couch, a full stocked kitchen for cooking in, and a great bathroom with a claw foot soaking tub (and shower). Great location with easy access to Sackville and Silver Lake. Stop in and check out the Campbell Carriage Factory.<br/>We will definitely book again when we visit Sackville."
28258068,6.91981E+17,Sackville,44785,60653560,Gwendolyn,It was a great place to stay near Hopewell Rocks. Very clean and simple!
28258068,6.98523E+17,Sackville,44794,101566789,Caroline,"A spacious, beautiful, and unique stay! The schoolhouse had everything we needed, especially the kitchen (you could cook anything your heart desired in it). Freddett was great about communicating and answered questions super quickly. We are so thankful we got to stay in such a great place during our trip!"
28258068,7.04258E+17,Sackville,44802,269059558,Bruce,We found this spot charming and very well equipped.  There was everything one could ever want in the kitchen and the bright and sunny space was very relaxing.  We found lots of good hikes and even a pretty disc golf course.  It was close to Moncton and it was easy to access the highway.  We found the communication with the host to be top notch.
28258068,7.0939E+17,Sackville,44809,54864397,Doralin,"A unique AirBnB with loads of schoolhouse character and a great ""treehouse"" view. The old bed needs replacing and upgraded dishes would have been nice.  But overall a great stay!"
28258068,7.18767E+17,Sackville,44822,194726915,Susan,"The loft offers a wonderful and comfortable ambiance. It is open, bright and roomy and provides everything needed for a short or long-term visit. The host is welcoming and responsive. We are planning our next visit."
28258068,7.32613E+17,Sackville,44841,211204103,Anne Marie,Great apartment. Fredette was very accommodating and responsive. Highly recommend!
28258068,7.42011E+17,Sackville,44854,264794908,Jean,"A peaceful retreat from city life. The schoolhouse setting with vintage furnishings and rustic character makes for a lovely ambiance. Spotlessly clean, private, ample kitchen amenities, excellent wifi connection, huge comfy living area, good heating system (October nights were chilly). Fredette was so nice and super attentive to our needs. Easy check-in. The double bed was not ideal for us, but as mentioned by others, the coziness adds to the charm. The schoolhouse is one of many historic buildings in Sackville (it operated as an elementary school until 1954) and staying here is a great way to experience a little bit of history with all the modern-day comforts you’ll need during a Sackville stay."
28258068,7.56512E+17,Sackville,44874,6333098,Jon,"I've been using Airbnb since it first launched, I've stayed in many places but this is one of my favorites if not my #1 favorite.<br/><br/>I loved the sense of history from its schoolhouse roots and some of the elements that were pulled through. It's rustic, cozy and warm off a quiet country road. The kitchen is fully stocked as are the bookshelves.<br/><br/>Sackville is tiny but cute, if you're looking for a weekend away from a loud metropolis or a longer stay (like if you're doing a residency at Mount Allison Univ for example) consider staying here. Please understand this is an uncommonly strong recommendation."

31411652,452122228,Sackville,43597,171588124,Mike,The house was amazing - thanks to Andrew for a fantastic spot.
31411652,452968067,Sackville,43599,31627170,Marjorie,Jordan's house is large and spacious. All of the amenities are covered. We had a very comfortable stay here.
31411652,463571114,Sackville,43619,49734867,Rachel,A very charming older historical home with many neat touches. We enjoyed our stay. Very private and quiet.
31411652,470694062,Sackville,43632,258088795,Jaimie,Beautiful home with great touches. Quick on responses when messaging.
31411652,472359569,Sackville,43635,42115428,Jennifer,Three of us had a nice stay at Andrews house. It’s in a great location steps from downtown Sackville. It’s an older home so has its quirks and some areas a bit dated but also has beautiful bones and character. The sitting area is very large and really nice place to sit and chat or watch TV. Nice patio set out back. The only thing to be aware of is one small bathroom on the main floor only so it’s a bit of a trek from your upstairs bedrooms.  There are very detailed instructions on how to work everything and recommendations for food etc. would happily stay here again. Thanks Andrew.
31411652,479777113,Sackville,43647,56986951,Barbara,"Greenslades is a gem of a house and property that combines 19th century grandeur with a full complement of modern amenities. From the beveled old glass windows that create rainbows, to the grand staircase, you are invited into the past, when gracious living was possible. Add to that a huge kitchen with dishwasher, washer/dryer, and a smooth-top electric range.....what could be bad??? Andrew has an extensive collection of rare and antique books that could keep you occupied for your whole stay. That is, if you weren't listening to his amazing vinyl collection. There is a sweet back deck, a lovely yard with old trees, and the beds are luxurious and comfy. This is a jewel. We hope to come back, if our review doesn't spark a horde of reservations!!  Seriously, this is a very special place. Andrew is a responsive and welcoming host. Not one negative thing to say about this experience, except that we had to leave."
31411652,484254144,Sackville,43654,262499132,Randall,I highly recommend Andrew's house in Sackville NB. The house and area are very nice and it's easy to walk to the downtown and Mount Allison University.
31411652,493502163,Sackville,43668,31975948,Tony,"place was great for our 11 day stay- Owner communicated with us with any questions we had, as well gave us the heads up on the bathroom being on the main level - looks like that is being fixed quickly tho in the upstairs. excellent place to stay, would do so again"
31411652,504320546,Sackville,43684,123228040,Martin,"This house has a soul. Great place for family and friends; board games, great collection of vinyls, lots of books, nice dining room, patio, etc."
31411652,507470470,Sackville,43688,10212778,Marta,Beautiful century home located steps from downtown Sackville where all of the cute coffee shops and restaurants are located.  Andrew was a fantastic host who communicated with us promptly. Incredible record collection (seriously the best part) and a large and private backyard. Fantastic living space for gathering with friends. Excellent value. The place will look extra special when the renos are complete!
31411652,512557997,Sackville,43695,100106474,Linda,"The entire house had a comfortable feeling. The bedroom colours were cozy & the bedding fantastic. The grounds were great, and the kitchen window epic.  It will take several trips to get through that record collection. We started each day with a new album from the collection over breakfast. Walking to town was a breeze! Great for after dinner walks too-saw three deer one morning just down the street."
31411652,513438756,Sackville,43696,255484587,Gabriel,"Such a beautiful, quiet, clean place in a lovely town. Be prepared to spend A LOT of time rummaging through Andrew's fantastic vinyl collection!"
31411652,519409263,Sackville,43705,124897100,Kaylea,Andrew's place is absolutely beautiful! We felt like we were in a dream! We had gone down for a wedding not knowing where anything in sackville was only to discover it was a quick walk from everywhere we needed. It was amazing! Thank you so much!
31411652,523383652,Sackville,43711,284022496,Edward,"A beautiful & stylish house. We enjoyed our stay very much. The rate, however, was perhaps a bit high given the renovation of the main bath during our stay. But it was very nice to have a whole house."
31411652,538120351,Sackville,43737,73887776,Sara,Andrew is a great host (quick replies and the place was nicely kept) and the house was perfect for us. We would go back!
31411652,542520543,Sackville,43744,201851994,Pamela,"Andrew's house is lovely and full of charming details. The book and album collections, the carved handrail and detailed staircase, the sunroom, the old glass and plate ware, as well as the bitters collection add an extra note of authentic to this already well-situated house. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the linens and towels were fresh and crisp."
31411652,562958736,Sackville,43780,55714888,Joel,"Charming, wonderful old home!!!! Centrally located but private. Amazing record collection, books everywhere, comfortable deluxe bedding and mattresses, a perfect spot to explore the area or hide out for a few days. HIGHLY recommended."
31411652,577511235,Sackville,43814,259204514,Amanda,"Surpassed all expectations. Fantastic details and a beautiful space overall. Had everything you might need and more. Our entire evening centered around the amazing record collection. We were also the first guests to have the newly renovated upstairs bathroom and it was superb. Also a very short walk in to town of Sackville and Andrew was extremely accommodating as a host, 10/10!"
31411652,660218956,Sackville,44078,12924233,Cynthia,"This was our first trip to Sackville, NB to drop off our daughter at Mount Allison University. We couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay!  <br/><br/>Andrew’s home met all of our needs — spacious, clean, close to the university, great value for the cost. Checking in and out was simple and stress-free. Andrew was quick to answer any questions we had during our stay. By all accounts, the beds were super comfortable. There were 6 in our group, so that is saying something! <br/><br/>It was a short visit so we didn’t have a chance to dive into Andrew’s truly magnificent LP collection. Wow!  We did, however, eat at 3 of Sackville’s restaurants: Joey’s Pizza & Pasta, Song’s Chopsticks, and Mel’s They did not disappoint!! <br/><br/>We are very much looking forward to our next visit to Sackville, NB. Fingers crossed that Andrew’s place will be available!"
31411652,666770626,Sackville,44095,100388104,Shelley,"Wonderful historic home, description is very accurate. It's a huge house! The location can't be beat for this area - minutes to downtown by foot. I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in the area."
31411652,4.38355E+17,Sackville,44435,31975948,Tony,"Our favorite place to stay not only for comfort, but also for rustic feel- its stepping back in time and we love rocking out to the record players !"
31411652,4.41229E+17,Sackville,44439,29905047,Howard,The palce is a must visit if you love classical music and books. It is so tastefully decorated.
31411652,4.44781E+17,Sackville,44444,26922077,Becky,Gorgeous historic home in the heart of Sackville. Was the perfect place for our family to stay as we got our daughters settled at Mount Allison. Would highly recommend!
31411652,4.52069E+17,Sackville,44454,138379690,Chris,Perfect stopover to enjoy the town and surrounding area!
31411652,4.54948E+17,Sackville,44458,9562324,Samantha,"This house is absolutely incredible. I had such a fantastic time here and I cannot wait until I can book another weekend away. The beds were comfortable and the natural lighting made the entire house feel welcoming. The backyard is so serene I almost couldn't tear myself away to come back inside. You can tell how much love was put into this place by looking at all the tiny details in every single corner. I'm a little upset with myself for only booking this place for a single weekend, I could have stayed forever. <br/>The host was quick to respond and very kind. The town of Sackville is adorable and although small, had everything we needed. I would highly recommend coming in autumn, as the temperature is perfect and the changing leaves make any and all views stunning."
31411652,4.81074E+17,Sackville,44494,185488492,Deborah,Beautiful historic house! The beds were very comfortable. Andrew was a super host.  Nearby almost every commodity.
31411652,4.89757E+17,Sackville,44506,95767289,Gaelen,Enchanting digs!
31411652,4.91982E+17,Sackville,44509,2609554,Pj,"We got to Andrew's house just after sunset so did not initially take in the exterior, but the interior is where it all happens. I love staying in real places that I find on AirBnB and Andrew's place is very much that. Filled with books, games, art and beautiful furnishings, you can spend hours looking at details and contents. Everything was as described, but nothing could describe the house when filled with morning light as it was the next morning. Sitting in the back porch for coffee made one feel a bit sad to be packing up so soon and leaving. The house is spacious and sweet and only a short walk into the centre of Sackville. A perfect spot for a stay"
31411652,4.95608E+17,Sackville,44514,124035703,James,"What a fabulous long weekend.  The house has a beautiful soul you can feel.  Beautiful large rooms. The parlor is amazing.  The light in the place evolves through the day, and is gorgeous all day.  Andrew was totally attentive.  Thank you!"
31411652,5.19526E+17,Sackville,44547,34031159,Libby,"Andrew’s place was perfect for a visit to Sackville, we only came for 1 night but the accommodation would be suitable for long term stays with everything you could need for a family or group.   <br/>The instructions were really clear, easy to navigate check in and Andrew was very responsive.   The location is ideal for exploring the town within east walking distance of all the local shops and restaurants.  <br/>The house itself is a beautiful old home with loads of character and charm, comfortable beds with lots of seating in the common areas for people to chat, play games, listen to the records or play a tune on the piano.   There is an extensive book collection throughout the house so lots on hand to keep people entertained.  <br/>Looking forward to our next visit!"
31411652,5.27522E+17,Sackville,44558,2824492,Elizabeth,"Beautiful home with tons of space. Every room is beautiful and has so much character. A short walk downtown, with a beautiful property."
31411652,6.28163E+17,Sackville,44697,222114775,John,"Our stay with Andrew was fantastic! He met us at check in and give us a tour of the house, with some interesting history about the place. The house is very spacious and very comfortable. The rooms are tastefully decorated and if you like to read, there are more books than you will ever need. Kitchen has everything you need, and a bbq on the back deck as well. Would definitely stay with Andrew again!"
31411652,6.32579E+17,Sackville,44703,3107679,Kara,"What a find! You can’t go wrong with Andrew’s place - great location, beautifully decorated, and well stocked with everything you could possibly need. Andrew popped by at check-in to show us around, and was available throughout our stay to answer questions. The house is clean, bright, spacious, and comfortable. Great outdoor space in the front and back yards (complete with hammock!) and you could spend days exploring Andrew’s collection of books, records, and games. This is a gem - you won’t be disappointed!"
31411652,6.39108E+17,Sackville,44712,411776654,Jennifer,What a fantastic place to stay in beautiful Sackville. The location is perfect and allowed us to easily walk downtown. The house is welcoming and provided so much space for our family.  We felt like it was our home!  Andrew is an awesome host and made sure our stay was perfect!
31411652,6.53526E+17,Sackville,44732,122438846,Tammy,The house is beautiful and well equipped. It’s a wonderful place for a large group to gather! Andrew is a terrific host. He was responsive and communicated well.
31411652,6.5789E+17,Sackville,44738,138004323,Ben,"This historic type building has been well maintained and kept. With a beautiful back yard and stunning interior main living area with great cleanliness and appropriate decoration props throughout. <br/>The host was helpful and very thoughtful having left a nice gift for our special occasion, a wedding. The house and property made a fantastic area for the groomsman to get ready and many photo opportunities.<br/>Thanks again Andrew.<br/>The Goodwins"
31411652,6.6225E+17,Sackville,44744,54629,Bruce,"Greenslades was the perfect place for our family vacation in Sackville. The house looks to be of average size from the driveway, but as soon as you push open the yellow front door, expect to gasp. The large things impress: enormous windows letting the light from the tree shaded yard, the gorgeously restored stairway, the formal dining room and the informal back sunporch. Then you notice the smaller delights: books everywhere, a piano, stacks of records and a turntable, William Morris style wallpaper, art on the walls, and china in the glass faced cupboards. Then in the course of normal daily activities you come to realize that it is equipped with just about anything one might need for the various necessities of life. The house setting is wonderful for explorations on foot in the town, and centrally located for trips around New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and PEI. Andrew is a kind and attentive host, always ready to be of assistance."
31411652,6.681E+17,Sackville,44752,167800678,Tammy,Andrew's place was amazing. Exceptionally clean and had everything we needed for our accommodation. I highly recommend staying at Andrew's if you are visiting Sackville NB.
31411652,6.72377E+17,Sackville,44758,107843089,Terrie,"Greenslade was an amazing place to stay.  Beautiful old home beautifully decorated with antiques.  Had everything we needed.  Location was good for us, we had a car so drove out to our locations.  Would highly recommend."
31411652,6.76088E+17,Sackville,44763,186283671,Jennifer,My family and I truly enjoyed our stay in this beautiful home. It was spacious enough for 5 adults and 2 children to be more than comfortable and the book and record collection was amazing and a delight to explore. The space is beautiful and filled with charm. Andrew was a great host who responded quickly and was very friendly. <br/><br/>We recommend the place highly.  :)
31411652,6.78167E+17,Sackville,44766,81344023,Gordon,A charming home and a lovely host! It was perfect!
31411652,6.934E+17,Sackville,44787,217976275,Jessie,We cannot say enough good things about the home and Andrew. Everything was perfect and would stay again!
31411652,6.99206E+17,Sackville,44795,437278982,John,This Sackville home was just wonderful. Perfect walking distance from the center of town its super quiet at night. High ceilings and an elegant feel we all fell in love with the house. The home was obviously the residence of some wealthy folks back in the day. Very spacious. The bedrooms were a little stuffy but with a fan it was fine. I think it has a central air unit as well as a minisplit so it was just perfect inside on the warmish days we experienced. The home has an amazing variety of books. I just wish we could stay longer.
31411652,7.08662E+17,Sackville,44808,19992813,Sherry,"Greenslades is a great place to stay if you’re travelling to Sackville! The house is spacious and convenient - it’s an easy walk to the restaurants downtown and to beautiful Waterfowl Park. Andrew was very responsive to any questions I had, and he’s stocked the house with everything you need and a lot more. We enjoyed looking through the shelves and shelves of books, and exploring the record collection! It was a fun launch pad for our daughter before moving in at Mount Allison University, and we’ve already booked our next visit."
31411652,7.41252E+17,Sackville,44853,44863727,Darcy,"Absolutely beautiful place! Such a cool little gem, which was so fun to stay in. So much character!"

31411652,7.55079E+17,Sackville,44872,356027792,Lisa,We loved staying in the beautiful and well appointed home.  The beds were super comfy and Andrew had all of the comforts of home.  He thought of everything!  Tons of books to read and games to play.  We will definitely be staying here again 😊
31411652,7.68829E+17,Sackville,44891,18579325,Lisa,My son had knee surgery locally and reserved this home for the week to help him recover.  It was wonderfully warm and beautiful and so spacious.  Beds were so soft and comfy and it literally had everything you could possibly need for a stay that feels like home.  I would highly recommend and we will be back next football season with friends!!
31411652,8.20301E+17,Sackville,44962,257671801,Kelley,"We stayed at Andrews place for a regional meeting. Andrews home is amazing , many beautiful and unique decorations, lots and lots of room, and a very warm and cozy atmosphere. Andrew was very responsive and accomodating to our needs. I would definitely recommend this space to anyone. The house alone is fun to explore. We were meeting so did not have a lot of time to do much in Sackville but Andrew left many great suggestions. Thank you Andrew for letting us use your lovely space!"
31411652,8.41277E+17,Sackville,44991,224229579,Dave,"Amazingly furnished and decorated with lots of books, games and vinyl albums (!) to keep entertained with."
37687157,5.27435E+17,Sackville,44558,7582684,Kerri,Such a beautiful and tranquil place. The lake is gorgeous. Louise is a gracious and friendly host. We absolutely loved our stay. Highly recommended for anyone looking to recharge.
37687157,5.28898E+17,Sackville,44560,76414460,Caroline,"This place was amazing! So beautiful and peaceful and an excellent first experience for us in Canada! It has everything you need with beautiful views and even a little trail that is perfect for dogs. Our only regret was that we had to leave so soon. We had to leave at 5 am, but the hosts were so wonderful they gave us bacon, eggs, bread, jam, and butter to make our own breakfast. They even brought us coffee. Could not recommend this air bnb enough. <br/>Word to the wise: don’t be dumb like us and not listen to Louise’s directions. Google maps brings you to the wrong side of the lake!"
37687157,5.3043E+17,Sackville,44562,40622720,Nundini,"Cute, cozy getaway! Loved the view of the lake and Louise was very quick in responding to all our questions. She helped set up the fire pit for us and shovelled snow off the deck as soon as it snowed. There aren’t a ton of restaurants close by so we brought own food and used the kitchen which was great."
37687157,5.35468E+17,Sackville,44569,395679772,Jonathan,Louise and Michael are both amazing people with a super comfy and restful property right on the lake. My daughter and I stayed one night and wish we could have stayed longer. It was so restful and peaceful. The living quarters is fully equipped with everything you could need for a weekend getaway!

37687157,5.56525E+17,Sackville,44598,80732879,Thomas,Great place to stay! Louise and Mike are great hosts and made sure we had everything we needed. They even shovelled out an area for a fire after a big storm and accommodated us with a late-check out! Highly recommend staying here winter or summer!
37687157,5.61564E+17,Sackville,44605,1271487,Rachel,"Highly recommend staying <br/>in such a beautiful location, with amazing views!<br/>Louise and Michael are excellent hosts.<br/>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Les hôtes savent recevoir leurs visiteurs de façon exceptionnelle."

45794892,7.03573E+17,Sackville,44801,82314221,Molly,"Jeff’s place was very unique and beautifully decorated! However, the lack of ac was not ideal in the warm weather as the unit is on the top floor. The bed was not very comfortable either.<br/>If you’re staying in cooler weather this is probably a great spot, but would recommend maybe bringing your own pillows to make the bed more comfortable. The mattress is very hard"

The space was clean, comfortable and thoughtfully stocked with everything you need including extras in the conveniently spacious storage closet. Consistently, Kathy was extremely responsive, clear and organized in her communication.  Both Kathy and her husband were kind and gracious to interact with.<br/><br/>The house is in a great location - close to Moncton and accessible to lots of trails, not to mention a park and 18 hole disc golf course.  If not for Covid-19, we would have also enjoyed its proximity to PEI and Nova Scotia.<br/><br/>Stay here if you're on the fence.  You won't regret it : )"
46426706,733317762,Sackville,44248,385402137,Avery,"A very clean and bright space! I completed my 14-day self isolation there and I can attest to its coziness.

I would definetly recommend to stay and I will  be staying at Kathy's place for my further visits to Sackville."

The apartment was very clean and the upgraded kitchen was wonderful to cook in. The apartment was filled with extra amenities like toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, extra towels, a hair dryer, coffee, tea, sugar, cooking oil, just to name a few! Kathy went above and beyond to be available if we needed anything. We hope Kathy's place is available next time we travel to Sackville!"
46426706,4.41197E+17,Sackville,44439,390411242,Nicole,"Kathy was a wonderful host for my 3-month stay in Sackville. The space is clean, convenient and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped with updated appliances and everything you can think of to cook your favourite meal. Kathy ensured I had everything I needed for my extended stay including many household items and she was very easy to get in contact with if needed. The location is great, right outside of town, and very quiet. I would highly recommend Kathy’s Airbnb!"

We'd recommend Kathy's place to anyone."

46426706,5.20981E+17,Sackville,44549,428393120,Jakob,"Could not have asked for kinder, more accommodating, more communicative hosts. They made my stay as easy as possible and I wouldn't have changed a thing."

46426706,6.62962E+17,Sackville,44745,145263919,Janet,"Kathy's place is very clean, it backs onto green space and trees so it's also very quiet.  I stayed during some very hot days in the summer but the air conditioning in the unit made the space comfortable.  Kathy is very easy to reach if you need anything and she has provided everything you could possibly need for your stay, it's like being at home. The clothes washer and dryer is private and is really convenient to use which was great during my longer stay.  The wifi connection was very good and I had no issues throughout my stay.<br/>I would recommend Kathy's place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Sackville!"
46426706,6.89128E+17,Sackville,44781,115817691,Jenny,Thank you Kathy for a lovely stay :)
46426706,6.94155E+17,Sackville,44788,96738213,Deb,Bright and sparkling clean apartment with everything you could possibly want for a stay of a few days or longer. You would never know that it is a basement suite. They have a heat pump which means cooler interior in the summer. They also have everything you could want in terms of cooking implements and linens. Kathy is lovely to deal with. We have no hesitation recommending this place.

An array of small snacks and useful breakfast ingredients awaited in the fridge and the shelves, like orange juice, milk, cereal, instant oatmeal, popcorn. Also coffee. The apartment was in wonderful shape, nearly new, and well laid out with everything we might have needed. Pleasant, quiet neighborhood out at the edge of town.

It's on a nice quiet street that would have been lovely for nice walks into town had we not picked a week with such bad weather. But on the other hand, the weather permitted me to discover Nancy's wonderful book collection. :-) My husband was working from home and the internet was completely reliable for zoom meetings etc. Would stay again."
51921827,5.68793E+17,Sackville,44615,22360394,Michelle,"Cute and cozy and perfect. I rented this Airbnb for my Mom so that she could safely come and see our newborn baby (do a few days in quarantine before staying at our house to ensure that the vulnerable new baby wasn’t exposed to the CoVid virus) My mom had everything she could dream of needing, Nancy was speedy-quick in responding when we had a question and she made it super easy when we wanted to add a day to our stay.  The house is so adorable and comfortable and the walls are filled with gorgeous paintings, prints and photographs, whereas the shelves are fully stocked with fantastic books. Both a welcomed bonus!! ❤️ Thanks for everything!"

Had snowed the night before and stairs and deck were shoveled as best they could with the ice.  They were salted as well . Beds were extremely comfortable.

She asked that I crate him while I was out, which I do anyway and which is a completely reasonable request. Although I needed to stay only 1 night this time, I would definitely book it for longer for another visit. I loved the space and the area. I was able to feel settled during my quick visit.

54014335,6.6298E+17,Sackville,44745,26104996,Jenelle,"A perfect nature getaway. We had a fairy tale weekend exploring the area and enjoying all the property has to offer. The location is breathtaking, we loved watching the tide throughout the day. It's surrounded by nature, a nicely cared for trail and path along the bay as well as a lookout and so much wildlife (porcupines, bunnies, chipmunks, birds). The Guest House is very well equipped with everything we needed to cook meals and even had extra odds and ends (floss, beach towels, coffee, etc) in case we forgot it. The gymbrary is a great touch, we really enjoyed playing darts. We had a campfire and Anita went out of her way to bring us some extra/drier wood. Fantastic hosts and fantastic place. One of the best trips we've had. The location is nicely situated only 20 minutes from Sackville for groceries or restaurants."

We would absolutely stay here again. <br/><br/>Key things of note: <br/>- Spotlessly clean<br/>- no spiders or webs (I really appreciated this, as my partner is afraid of them)<br/>- ceiling fans in both bedrooms <br/>- big, surprisingly big!<br/>- just lovely sunrise and sunset views of the bay <br/><br/>Some tips: <br/>- you’ll want to bring your own drinking water, as the tap water smells of sulphur (according to the internet this is harmless)<br/>- definitely bring mosquito repellent if you plan to do any outdoor activities, especially by the beach <br/>The nearest grocery story is about 23 miles away, so you’ll want to stock up on essentials <br/><br/>Anita was a gracious friendly host and we thank her for the opportunity to visit her truly lovely and magical home."
54014335,7.36197E+17,Sackville,44846,37527964,Desiree,All the thoughtful touches made for a special trip. This is a lovely serene place I would love to return for another visit.

Check-in was easy and she was quick to provide anything we needed, like access to a BBQ, etc.<br/><br/>The space itself was a bit smaller than we expected, but we still had plenty of room for what we needed. The space was cozy and comfortable, well-furnished and decorated.  We didn't realize that there is no TV included, but that just meant we got to do more walking, enjoy the sunsets over the bay and just spend quiet time together instead of being glued to a screen... which is a good thing! <br/><br/>Since our goal was mostly to play board games during our stay, the large wooden table in the sun room was perfect for us.<br/><br/>The property itself is well-maintained and we enjoyed seeing a few squirrels and wild rabbits running around. We also got to see hundreds of local shorebirds on the beach.  There are walking trails and lots of outdoorsy things to do that we did not partake in, but could have.<br/><br/>The weather itself was cooler than in the city and there was a nice breeze most of the time.  <br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay! Thanks!"
54017528,6.89052E+17,Sackville,44781,148522865,Jeff,Great spot overlooking the bay with easy access to local trail along the coast.  Cozy and quiet.  Highly recommend.

The location was 100/5! with access to the beach and a lookout to the bay of Fundy. Anita is very communicative and would respond pretty quickly. I definitely recommend this cottage.

The hosts were welcoming and went out of their way to make sure we had a great visit. Last but not least, the cottage is  a 30 second down their property to a truly spectacular view out over the Bay of Fundy."
